<p class="drop-cap">THE &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic,&#8221; &#8220;the
crimson flower of battle,&#8221; bloomed in a
single night. It sprang from the very soil of the
conflict, in the midst of the Civil War. Yet the
plant which produced it was of slow growth, with
roots reaching far back into the past.</p>

<p>In order to understand how this song of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
nation sprang into sudden being we must study
that stormy past&mdash;the prelude of the Civil War.
How greatly it affected my mother we shall see
from her own record, as well as from the story of
the events that touched her so nearly. My own
memory of them dates back to childhood&#8217;s days.
Yet they moved and stirred my soul as few things
have done in a long life.</p>

<p>Therefore I have striven to give to the present
generation some idea of the fervor and ferment,
the exaltation of spirit, that prevailed at that
epoch among the soldiers of a great cause, especially
as I saw it in our household.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p class="center">Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel.</p>


<p>So many years have elapsed since the evil
monster of slavery was done to death that we
sometimes forget its awful power in the middle
of the last century. The fathers of the Republic
believed that it would soon perish. They forbade
its entrance into the Territories and were careful
to make no mention of it in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The invention of the cotton-gin changed the
whole situation. It was found that slave labor
could be used with profit in the cultivation of the
cotton crop. But slave labor with its wasteful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
methods exhausted the soil. Slavery could only
be made profitable by constantly increasing its
area. Hence, the Southern leaders departed from
the policy of the fathers of the Republic. Instead
of allowing slavery to die out, they determined to
make it perpetual. Instead of keeping it within
the limits prescribed by the ancient law of the
land, they resolved to extend it.</p>

<p>The Missouri Compromise of 1820 gave the first
extension of slavery, opening the great Territory of
Missouri to the embrace of the serpent. The fugitive-slave
law was signed in 1850. Before this time
the return of runaway negroes had been an uncertain
obligation. The new law took away from
State magistrates the decision in cases of this sort
and gave it to United States Commissioners. It
imposed penalties on rescues and denied a jury
trial to black men arrested as fugitives, thus
greatly endangering the liberties of free negroes.
The Dred Scott decision (see page 10), denying
that negroes could be citizens, was made in
1854. In 1856 the Missouri Compromise was repealed
by the Kansas and Nebraska law.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
territory was thrown open to the sinister
institution which now threatened to become like
the great Midgard snake, holding our country in
its suffocating embrace, as that creature of fable
surrounded the earth. It was necessary to fling
off the deadly coils of slavery if we were to endure
as a free nation.</p>

<p>The first step was to arouse the sleeping conscience
of the people. For the South was not
alone in wishing there should be no interference
with their &#8220;peculiar institution.&#8221; The North was
long supine and dreaded any new movement
that might interfere with trade and national
prosperity. I can well remember my father&#8217;s
pointing this out to his children, and inveighing
against the selfishness of the merchants as a class.
Alas! it was a Northern man, Stephen A. Douglas,
who was the father of the Kansas and Nebraska
bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trumpet note of Garrison&#8221; had sounded,
some years before this time, the first note of anti-slavery
protest. But the Garrisonian abolitionists
did not seek to carry the question into politics.
Indeed, they held it to be wrong to vote under the
Federal Constitution, &#8220;A league with death and
a covenant with hell,&#8221; as they called it. Whittier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the Quaker poet, took a more practical view
than his fellow-abolitionists and advocated the use
of the ballot-box.</p>

<p>When the encroachments of the slave power
began to threaten seriously free institutions
throughout the country, thinking men at the
North saw that the time for political action had
come. There were several early organizations
which preceded the formation of the Republican
party&mdash;the Liberty party, Conscience Whigs, Free-soilers,
as they were called. My father belonged
to the two latter, and I can well remember that
my elder sister and I were nicknamed at school,
&#8220;Little Free-Dirters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The election of Charles Sumner to the United
States Senate was an important victory for the
anti-slavery men. Dr. Howe, as his most intimate
friend, worked hard to secure it. Yet we see by
my father&#8217;s letters that he groaned in spirit at
the necessity of the political dickering which he
hated.</p>

<p>Women in those days neither spoke in public
nor took part in political affairs. But it may be
guessed that my mother was deeply interested in
all that was going on in the world of affairs, and
under her own roof, too, for our house at South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Boston became one of the centers of activity of
the anti-slavery agitation.</p>

<p>My father (who was some seventeen years
older than his wife) well understood the power of
the press. He had employed it to good effect in his
work for the blind, the insane, and others. Hence
he became actively interested in the management
of the <i>Commonwealth</i>, an anti-slavery newspaper,
and with my mother&#8217;s help edited it for an entire
winter. They began work together every morning,
he preparing the political articles, and she
the literary ones. Burning words were sent forth
from the quiet precincts of &#8220;Green Peace.&#8221; My
mother had thus named the homestead, lying in
its lovely garden, when she came there early in
her married life. Little did she then dream that
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise would disturb
its serene repose some ten years later.</p>

<p>The agitation had not yet become so strong as
greatly to affect the children of the household.
We played about the garden as usual and knew little
of the <i>Commonwealth</i> undertaking, save as it
brought some delightful juveniles to the editorial
sanctum. The little Howes highly approved of
this by-product of journalism!</p>

<p>Our mother&#8217;s pen had been used before this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
to help the cause of the slave. As early as 1848
she contributed a poem to <i>The Liberty Bell</i>, an
annual edited by Mrs. Maria Norton Chapman
and sold at the anti-slavery bazars. &#8220;In my
first published volume, <i>Passion Flowers</i>, appeared
some lines &#8216;On the Death of the Slave Lewis,&#8217;
which were wrung from my indignant heart by a
story&mdash;alas! too common in those days&mdash;of murderous
outrage committed by a master against his
human chattel&#8221; (<i>Recollections of the Anti-Slavery
Struggle</i>, Julia Ward Howe).</p>

<p>Another method of arousing the conscience of
the nation was through the public platform. My
father and his friends were anxious to present the
great question in a perfectly fair way. So a series
of lectures was given in Tremont Temple, where
the speakers were alternately the most prominent
advocates of slavery at the South and its most
strenuous opponents at the North. Senator
Toombs, of Georgia, and General Houston, of
Texas, were among the former.</p>

<p>It was, probably, at this lecture course that my
father exercised his office as chairman in an unusual
way. In those days it was the custom to
open the meeting with prayer, and some of the
contemporary clergymen were very long-winded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Dr. Howe informed each reverend gentleman beforehand
that at the end of five minutes he should
pull the latter&#8217;s coat-tail. The divines were in
such dread of this gentle admonition that they invariably
wound up the prayer within the allotted
time.</p>

<p>At this time no criticism of the &#8220;peculiar institution&#8221;
was allowed at the South. Northerners
traveling there were often asked for their opinion of
it, but any unfavorable comment evoked displeasure.
Indeed, a friend of ours, a Northern
woman teaching in Louisiana, was called to book
because in his presence she spoke of one of the
slaves as a &#8220;man.&#8221; A negro, she was informed,
was not a man, and must never be so called. &#8220;Boy&#8221;
was the proper term to use. This was a logical
inference from Judge Taney&#8217;s famous Dred Scott
decision&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, that &#8220;such persons,&#8221; <i>i. e.</i>, negroes,
&#8220;were not included among the people&#8221; in the
words of the Declaration of Independence, and
could not in any respect be considered as citizens.
Yet, to quote Abraham Lincoln again, &#8220;Judge
Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in five
of the then thirteen States&mdash;to wit, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and
North Carolina&mdash;free negroes were voters, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
proportion to their numbers had the same part in
making the Constitution that the white people
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Events now began to move with ever-increasing
rapidity. The scenes of the stirring prelude to the
Civil War grew ever more stormy. Men became
more and more wrought up as the relentless
purpose of the Southern leaders was gradually
revealed. The deadly serpent of slavery became
a hydra-headed monster, striking north, east, and
west. The hunting of fugitive slaves took on a
sinister activity in the Northern &#8220;border&#8221; States;
at the national capital the attempts to muzzle free
speech culminated in the striking down of Charles
Sumner in the Senate Chamber itself; in Kansas
the &#8220;border ruffians&#8221; strove to inaugurate a
reign of terror, and succeeded in bringing on a local
conflict which was the true opening of the Civil
War.</p>

<p>The men who combated the dragon of slavery&mdash;the
Siegfrieds of that day&mdash;fought him in all
these directions. In Boston Dr. Howe was among
the first to organize resistance to the rendition of
fugitive slaves. An escaped negro was kidnapped
there in 1846. This was four years before the passage
by Congress of the fugitive-slave law made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
it the duty (!) of the Free States to return runaway
negroes to slavery. My father called a meeting of
protest at Faneuil Hall. He was the chief speaker
and &#8220;every sentence was a sword-thrust&#8221; (T. W.
Higginson&#8217;s account). I give a brief extract from
his address:</p>

<p>&#8220;The peculiar institution which has so long been
brooding over the country like an incubus has at
length spread abroad its murky wings and has
covered us with its benumbing shadow. It has
silenced the pulpit, it has muffled the press; its influence
is everywhere.... Court Street can find no
way of escape for the poor slave. State Street,
that drank the blood of the martyrs of liberty&mdash;State
Street is deaf to the cry of the oppressed
slave; the port of Boston that has been shut up
by a tyrant king as the dangerous haunt of free-men&mdash;the
port of Boston has been opened to the
slave-trader; for God&#8217;s sake, Mr. Chairman, let
us keep Faneuil Hall free!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and Theodore
Parker also spoke. John Quincy Adams presided
at the meeting.</p>

<p>The meeting resulted in the formation of a
vigilance committee of forty, with my father as
chairman. This continued its work until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
hunting of fugitives ceased in Boston. Secrecy
necessarily characterized its proceedings. An undated
note from Dr. Howe to Theodore Parker
gives us a hint of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="smcap">Dear T. P.</span>&mdash;Write me a note by bearer. Tell him merely
whether I am wanted to-night; if I am he will act accordingly
about bringing my wagon.</p>

<p>I could bring any one here and keep him secret a week and
no person except Mrs. H. and myself would know it.</p>

<p class="center">Yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chev</span>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This letter raises an interesting question. Were
fugitives concealed, unknown to us children, in
our house? It is quite possible, for both our
parents could keep a secret. I remember a young
white girl who was so hidden from her drunken
father until other arrangements could be made for
her. I remember also a negro girl, hardly more
than a child, who was secreted beneath the roof
of Green Peace. Her mistress had brought her to
Boston as a servant. Since she was not a runaway,
the provisions of the odious fugitive-slave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
law did not apply to her. Here at least we
could cry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">No fetters in the Bay State!</div>
<div class="verse">No slave upon her land!</div>
</div></div>

<p>My father applied to the courts and in due process
of time Martha was declared free&mdash;so long as she
remained on Northern soil. It may be guessed
that she did not care to return to the South!</p>

<p>The feeling of the community was strongly opposed
to taking part in slave-hunts. Yankee ingenuity
often found a way to escape this odious
task, and yet keep within the letter of the law.</p>

<p>A certain United States marshal thus explained
his proceedings:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never have any trouble about runaway
slaves. If I hear that one has come to
Boston I just go up to Nigger Hill [a part of Joy
Street] and say to them, &#8216;Do you know of any
runaway slaves about here?&#8217; And they never do!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a somewhat unique way of giving
notice to the friends of the fugitive that the
officers of the law were after him.</p>

<p>If he could only escape over the border into free
Canada he was safe. According to the English
law no slave could remain such on British soil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
The moment he &#8220;shook the Lion&#8217;s paw&#8221; he became
free. Our law in these United States is
founded on the English Common Law. Alas! the
pro-slavery party succeeded in overthrowing it.
No wonder that Senator Toombs, of Georgia,
boasted that he would call the roll of his slaves
under the shadow of Bunker Hill Monument.
The fugitive-slave law gave him the power to do
this, and thus make our boasted freedom of the
soil only an empty mockery.</p>

<p>The vigilance committee did its work well, and
for some time no runaway slaves were captured in
Boston. One poor wretch was finally caught.
My mother thus describes the event:</p>

<p>&#8220;At last a colored fugitive, Anthony Burns by
name, was captured and held subject to the
demands of his owner. The day of his rendition
was a memorable one in Boston. The courthouse
was surrounded by chains and guarded with
cannon. The streets were thronged with angry
faces. Emblems of mourning hung from several
business and newspaper offices. With a show of
military force the fugitive was marched through
the streets. No rescue was attempted at this
time, although one had been planned for an earlier
date. The ordinance was executed; Burns was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
delivered to his master. But the act once consummated
in broad daylight could never be repeated&#8221;
(from Julia Ward Howe&#8217;s <i>Recollections of
the Anti-Slavery Struggle</i>).</p>

<p>So great was the public indignation against the
judge who had allowed himself to be the instrument
of the Federal Government in the return of
Burns to slavery that he was removed from office.
Shortly afterward he left Boston and went to live
in Washington.</p>

<p>The attempts to enforce the fugitive-slave law
at the East failed, as they were bound to fail.
The efforts to muzzle free speech at the national
capital were more successful for a time.</p>

<p>The task of Charles Sumner in upholding the
principles of freedom in the United States Senate
was colossal. For long he stood almost alone, &#8220;A
voice crying in the wilderness, make straight the
paths of the Lord.&#8221; Fortunately he was endowed
by nature with a commanding figure and presence
and a wonderful voice that fitted him perfectly for
his great task. My mother thus described him:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was majestic in person, habitually reserved
and rather distant in manner, but sometimes unbent
to a smile in which the real geniality of his
soul seemed to shed itself abroad. His voice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
ringing and melodious, his gestures somewhat
constrained, his whole manner, like his matter,
weighty and full of dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an old and intimate friend, my father sometimes
urged him to greater haste in his task of
combating slavery at the national capital. Thus
Charles Sumner writes to him from Washington,
February 1, 1854:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Howe</span>&mdash;Do not be impatient with me. I am doing
all that I can. This great wickedness disturbs my sleep, my
rest, my appetite. Much is to be done, of which the world
knows nothing, in rallying an opposition. It has been said
by others, that but for Chase and Sumner this Bill would
have been rushed through at once, even without debate.
Douglas himself told me that our opposition was the only
sincere opposition he had to encounter. But this is not true.
There are others here who are in earnest.</p>

<p>My longing is to rally the country against the Bill<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
I desire to let others come forward and broaden our front.</p>

<p>Our Legislature ought to speak <i>unanimously</i>. Our people
should revive the old report and resolutions of 1820.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>At present our first wish is delay, that the country may
be aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that night or Bl&uuml;cher had come!&#8221;</p>

<p>God bless you always!</p>

<p class="right">C. S.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>In the fateful spring of 1856 Dr. and Mrs. Howe
were in Washington. They saw both Charles
Sumner and Preston Brooks. My mother has
given us pictures of the two men as she then saw
them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles Sumner looked up and, seeing me in
the gallery, greeted me with a smile of recognition.
I shall never forget the beauty of that smile.
It seemed to me to illuminate the whole precinct
with a silvery radiance. There was in it all the
innocence of his sweet and noble nature.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;At Willard&#8217;s Hotel I observed at a table near
our own a typical Southerner of that time, handsome,
but with a reckless and defiant expression
of countenance which struck me unpleasantly.
This was Preston Brooks, of South Carolina.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>During one of his visits to the Howes, Sumner
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall soon deliver a speech in the Senate
which will occasion a good deal of excitement. It
will not surprise me if people leave their seats and
show signs of unusual disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother comments thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;At the moment I did not give much heed to his
words, but they came back to me, not much later,
with the force of prophecy. For Mr. Sumner did
make this speech, and though at the moment
nothing was done against him, the would-be
assassin only waited for a more convenient season
to spring upon his victim and to maim him for life.
Choosing a moment when Mr. Sumner&#8217;s immediate
friends were not in the Senate Chamber,
Brooks of South Carolina, armed with a cane of
india-rubber, attacked him in the rear, knocking
him from his seat with one blow, and beating
him about the head until he lay bleeding and
senseless upon the floor. Although the partisans
of the South openly applauded this deed, its
cowardly brutality was really repudiated by all
who had any sense of honor, without geographical
distinction. The blow, fatal to Sumner&#8217;s health,
was still more fatal to the cause it was meant to
serve, and even to the man who dealt it. Within
one year his murderous hand was paralyzed in
death, and Sumner, after hanging long between
life and death, stood once more erect, with the
aureole of martyrdom on his brow, and with the
dear-bought glory of his scars a more potent
witness for the truth than ever. His place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
in the Senate remained for a time eloquently
empty.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Hon. Miles Taylor, of Louisiana, defended in the
Senate the attack on Sumner. A part of his
speech makes curious reading:</p>

<p>&#8220;If this new dogma&#8221; (the evil of slavery)
&#8220;should be received by the American people with
favor, it can only be when all respect for revelation ... has
been utterly swept away by such a
flood of irreligion and foul philosophy as never
before set in.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE CRIME AGAINST KANSAS</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>Border ruffians from Missouri carry Kansas elections with pistol and
bowie-knife. They prevent peaceable Free State emigrants from
entering the national territory&mdash;Dr. Howe carries out aid from New
England&mdash;Clergymen and Sharp&#8217;s rifles&mdash;Mrs. Howe&#8217;s indignant
verses&mdash;She opens the door for John Brown, the hero of the war
in Kansas&mdash;Gov. Andrew, Theodore Parker, Charles Sumner&mdash;The
attack on Fort Sumter&mdash;&#8220;The death-blow of slavery.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THESE assaults by the serpent of slavery on
the free institutions of the North and East
were dangerous enough, yet, like other evils, they
brought their own remedies with them. Such an
open attack on free speech as that on Sumner
was sure to be resented, while the forcible carrying-off
of fugitive slaves under the shadow of old
Faneuil Hall aroused a degree of wrath that even
the pro-slavery leaders saw was ominous.</p>

<p>&#8220;The crime against Kansas&#8221; was still more
alarming because it threatened to turn a free
Territory into a slave State. In 1854 the Kansas
and Nebraska bill had been passed, repealing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Missouri Compromise and exposing a vast area of
virgin soil to the encroachments of the &#8220;peculiar
institution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Free-soil men were speedily on the alert.
During that same year of 1854 two Massachusetts
colonies were sent out to Kansas, others
going later.</p>

<p>But the leaders of the slave power had no intention
of allowing men from the free States to settle
peacefully in Kansas. They had repealed the
Missouri Compromise with the express purpose of
gaining a new slave State, and this was to be accomplished
by whatever means were necessary.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to send men from Missouri
into the adjacent Territory of Kansas&mdash;to vote
there and then to return to their homes across the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Herald</i> of April 20, 1855, published
the following letter from a correspondent in
Brunswick, Missouri:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From five to seven thousand men started from Missouri
to attend the election, some to remove, but the most to return
to their families, with an intention, if they liked the
Territory, to make it their permanent abode at the earliest
moment practicable. But they intended to vote.... Indeed,
every county furnished its quota; and when they set out it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
looked like an army.... They were armed.... Fifteen hundred
wore on their hats bunches of hemp. They were resolved
if a tyrant attempted to trample upon the rights of the
sovereign people to hang him.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noted that &#8220;the rights of the sovereign
people&#8221; were to go to the ballot-box not in their
own, but in another State. These &#8220;border ruffians&#8221;
took possession of the polls and carried the
first election with pistol and bowie-knife.</p>

<p>The pro-slavery leaders strove to drive out the
colonists from the free States and to prevent additional
emigrants from entering the Territory. A
campaign of frightfulness was inaugurated&mdash;with
the usual result.</p>

<p>Governor Geary of Kansas, although a pro-slavery
official himself, wrote (Dec. 22, 1856) that
he heartily despised the abolitionists, but that
&#8220;<i>The persecutions of the Free State men here were
not exceeded by those of the early Christians.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>My father was deeply interested in the colonization
of Kansas and in the struggle for freedom
within its borders. He helped in 1854 to organize
the &#8220;New England Emigrant Aid Company&#8221;
which assisted parties of settlers to go to the
Territory. In 1856 matters began to look very
dark for the colonists from the free States. &#8220;Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Howe was stirred to his highest activity by the
news from Kansas and by the brutal assault on
Charles Sumner&#8221; (F. B. Sanborn). With others
he called and organized the Faneuil Hall meeting.
He was made chairman of its committee, and at
once sent two thousand dollars to St. Louis for
use in Kansas. This prompt action had an important
effect on the discouraged settlers. Soon
afterward he started for Kansas to give further
aid to the colonists.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have traversed the whole length of the State
of Iowa on horseback or in a cart, sleeping in
said cart or in worse lodgings, among dirty men
on the floor of dirty huts. We have organized
a pretty good line of communication between
our base and the corps of emigrants who have
now advanced into the Territory of Nebraska.
Everything depends upon the success of the attempt
to break through the <i>cordon infernale</i> which
Missouri has drawn across the northern frontier of
Kansas.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In another letter he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The boats on the river are beset by spies and ruffians,
are hauled up at various places and thoroughly searched for
anti-slavery men.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>He thus describes the emigrants:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Camp of the Emigration, Nebraska Territory</span>,<br />
<i>July 29, &#8217;56</i>.</p>

<p>The emigration is indeed a noble one; sturdy, industrious,
temperate, resolute men.... I wish our friends in the East
could know the character and behavior of these emigrants.
They are and have been for two weeks encamped out upon
these vast prairies in their tents and waggons waiting patiently
for the signal to move, exhausting all peaceful resources
and negotiations before resorting to force.</p>

<p>There is no liquor in the whole camp; no smoking, no
swearing, no irregularity. They drink cold water, live mostly
on mush and rice and the simplest, cheapest fare. They have
instruction for the little children; they have Sunday-schools,
prayer-meetings, and are altogether a most sober and earnest
community. Most of the loafers have dropped off. The
Wisconsin company, about one hundred, give a tone to all
the others. I could give you a picture of the drunken, rollicking
ruffians who oppose this emigration&mdash;but you know it.
Will the North allow such an emigration to be shut out
of the National Territory by such brigands?</p>
</div>

<p>In another letter he tells us that among the
emigrants were thirty-eight women and children&mdash;grandfathers
and grandmothers, too, journeying
with their live stock in carts drawn by oxen to
the promised land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>He says nothing of danger to himself, but Hon.
Andrew D. White tells us that &#8220;Dr. Howe had
braved death again and again while aiding the
Free State men against the pro-slavery myrmidons
of Kansas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The strength of the movement may be judged
from the fact that during this year (1856) the
people of Massachusetts sent one hundred thousand
dollars in money, clothing, and arms to help
the Free State colonists. This money did not
come from the radicals only, but from &#8220;Hunkers,&#8221;
as they were then called&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, conservative and
well-to-do citizens. My father wrote: &#8220;People
pay readily here for Sharp&#8217;s rifles. One lady
offered me one hundred dollars the other day,
and to-day a clergyman offered me one hundred
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother was greatly moved by these tragic
events&mdash;the assault on Sumner and the civil war
in Kansas. In <i>Words for the Hour</i>&mdash;a volume of
her poems published in 1857&mdash;we find a record of
her just indignation. In the &#8220;Sermon of Spring&#8221;
she describes Kansas as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Wearing the green nodding plumes of the Court of the Prairie,</div>
<div class="verse">Gyves on her free-born limbs, on her fair arms shackles,</div>
<div class="verse">Blood on her garments, terror and grief in her features.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Tremble,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;tho&#8217; the battle seem thine for a season,</div>
<div class="verse">Not a drop of my blood shall be wanting to judge thee.</div>
<div class="verse">Tremble, thou fallen from mercy ere fallen from office.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This poem, which is a long one, contains a
tribute to Sumner, as do also &#8220;Tremont Temple,&#8221;
&#8220;The Senator&#8217;s Return,&#8221; and &#8220;An Hour in the
Senate.&#8221; I give a brief extract from the last
named:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Falls there no lightning from yon distant heaven</div>
<div class="indent">To crush this man&#8217;s potential impudence?</div>
<div class="indent">Shall not its outraged patience thunder: &#8220;Hence!</div>
<div class="verse">Forsake the shrine where Liberty was given!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The strong shall rule, the arm of force have sway,</div>
<div class="indent">The helpless multitude in bonds abide&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">Again the chuckle and the shake of pride&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;God&#8217;s for the stronger&mdash;so great Captains say.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr class="tb" />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet, rise to answer, chafing in thy chair,</div>
<div class="indent">With soul indignant stirred, and flushing brow.</div>
<div class="indent">Thou art God&#8217;s candidate&mdash;speak soothly now,</div>
<div class="verse">Let every word anticipate a prayer.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">Bear up the hearts whose silent sorrows come</div>
<div class="verse">For utterance, to the voice that thou canst give.</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>In the same volume are verses entitled &#8220;Slave
Eloquence&#8221; and &#8220;Slave Suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>How did the children of the household feel during
this period of &#8220;Sturm und Drang&#8221;? To the
older ones, at least, it was a most exciting time.
While we did not by any means know of all that
was going on, we felt very strongly the electric
current of indignation that thrilled through our
home, as well as the stir of action. My father
early taught us to love freedom and to hate
slavery. He gave us, in brief, clear outline, the
story of the aggressions of the slave power. We
knew of the iniquity of the Dred Scott decision
before we were in our teens. Child that I was, I
was greatly moved when he repeated Lowell&#8217;s
well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,</div>
<div class="verse">Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.</div>
</div></div>

<p>My father had always something of the soldier
about him&mdash;a quick, active step, gallant bearing,
and a voice tender, yet strong, &#8220;A voice to lead a
regiment.&#8221; This was the natural consequence of
his early experiences in the Greek War of Independence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
when he served some seven years as
surgeon, soldier, and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;almoner
of America&#8217;s bounty to the peaceful
population. The latter would have perished of
starvation save for the supplies sent out in response
to Dr. Howe&#8217;s appeals to his countrymen.
The greater part of his life was devoted to the
healing arts of the good physician. Yet the portraits
of him, taken during the tremendous struggle
of the anti-slavery period, show a sternness not
visible in his younger nor yet in his later days.</p>

<p>In her poem &#8220;A Rough Sketch&#8221; my mother
described him as he seemed to her at this time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A great grieved heart, an iron will,</div>
<div class="indent">As fearless blood as ever ran;</div>
<div class="verse">A form elate with nervous strength</div>
<div class="indent">And fibrous vigor,&mdash;all a man.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Charles Sumner came often to Green Peace when
he was in Boston. We children greatly admired
him. He seemed to us, and doubtless to others,
a species of superman. I can hardly think of
those days without the organ accompaniment of
his voice&mdash;deeper than the depths, round and full.
When our friend was stricken down in the Senate,
great was our youthful indignation. Many were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the arguments held with our mates at school and
dancing-school, often the children of the &#8220;Hunker&#8221;
class. They sought to justify the attack, and we
replied with the testimony of an eye-witness to
the scene (Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President
of the United States) and the fact that a colleague
of Brooks stood, waving a pistol<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in each hand,
to prevent any interference in behalf of Sumner.
We had heard about the cruel &#8220;Mochsa&#8221; with
which his back was burned in the hope of cure, and
we lamented his sufferings.</p>

<p>John A. Andrew, afterward the War Governor
of the State, was another intimate of our household,
a great friend of both our parents. Genial
and merry, as a rule, he yet could be sternly eloquent
in the denunciation of slavery.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a speech of this nature which first
brought him into prominence. In the Massachusetts
Legislature of 1858 the most striking
figure was that of Caleb Cushing. He had been
Attorney-General in President Franklin Pierce&#8217;s
Cabinet and was one of the ablest lawyers in the
United States. When all were silent before his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
oratory and no one felt equal to opposing this
master of debate, Andrew, a young advocate, was
moved, like another David, to attack his Goliath.
In a speech of great eloquence he vindicated the
action of the Governor and the Legislature in
removing from office the judge who had sent
Anthony Burns back into slavery and thus outraged
the conscience of the Bay State. As a
lawyer he sustained his opinion by legal precedents.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he took his seat there was a storm of
applause. The House was wild with excitement.
Some members cried for joy; others cheered,
waved their handkerchiefs, and threw whatever
they could find into the air.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>And so, like David, he won not only the battle
of the day, but the leadership of his people in the
stormy times that soon followed.</p>

<p>When a box of copperhead snakes was sent to
our beloved Governor we were again indignant.
(Political opponents had not then learned to send
gifts of bombs.)</p>

<p>From Kansas itself Martin F. Conway came to
us, full of fiery zeal for the Free State cause, although
born south of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>He later represented the young State in Congress.
Samuel Downer and George L. Stearns we often
saw; both were very active in the anti-slavery
cause. The latter was remarkable for a very long
and beautiful beard, brown and soft, like a
woman&#8217;s hair and reaching to his waist.</p>

<p>We heard burning words about the duty of
Massachusetts during these assaults of the slave
power. Could she endure them, or should she not
rather seek to withdraw from the Union?</p>

<p>These words sound strangely to us now, but it
must be remembered that in the fifties we had seen
our fair Bay State made an annex to slave territory.
Men might well ask one another, &#8220;Can the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts endure the disgrace
of having slave-hunts within her borders?&#8221;
&#8220;The Irrepressible Conflict&#8221; had come. When
the pro-slavery leaders forced the fugitive-slave
law through Congress they struck a blow at the
life of the nation as deadly as that of Fort Sumter.
The latter was the inevitable sequel of the former.</p>

<p>We saw often at Green Peace another intimate
friend of our parents&mdash;Theodore Parker, the famous
preacher and reformer. As he wore spectacles
and was prematurely bald, he did not leave upon
our childish minds the impression of grandeur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
inseparably connected with Charles Sumner. Yet
the splendid dome of his head gave evidence of his
great intellect, while his blue eyes looked kindly
and often merrily at us. Having no children of
his own, he would have liked to adopt our youngest
sister, could our parents have been persuaded to
part with her.</p>

<p>Theodore Parker advocated the anti-slavery
cause with great eloquence in the pulpit. He also
belonged to my father&#8217;s vigilance committee and
harbored fugitive slaves in his own home. To one
couple of runaway negroes he presented a Bible and
a sword&mdash;after marrying them legally&mdash;a thing not
always done in the day of slavery. My father succeeded
in sending away from Boston the man who
attempted to carry them back to the South, and
William and Ellen Croft found freedom in England.</p>

<p>Theodore Parker&#8217;s sermons had a powerful influence
on his great congregation, of which my
mother was for some time a member. In one of
her tributes to him she tells us how he drew them
all toward the light of a better day and prepared
them also for &#8220;the war of blood and iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that it was by the spirit of the higher
humanity that he brought his hearers into sympathy
with all reforms and with the better society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that should ripen out of them. Freedom for
black and white, opportunity for man and woman,
the logic of conscience and the logic of progress&mdash;this
was the discipline of his pulpit.... Before
its [the Civil War&#8217;s] first trumpet blast blew his
great heart had ceased to beat. But a great body
of us remembered his prophecy and his strategy
and might have cried, as did Walt Whitman at a
later date, &#8216;O captain, my captain!&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Rev. James Freeman Clarke, our pastor for
many years, was among those whose visits gave
pleasure and inspiration as well to our household.
He did not hesitate to preach anti-slavery doctrines,
unpopular as they were, from his pulpit.
My mother says of him at this time:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the agitated period which preceded the Civil
War and in that which followed it he in his modest
pulpit became one of the leaders, not of his own
flock alone, but of the community to which he
belonged. I can imagine few things more instructive
and desirable than was his preaching in
those troublous times, so full of unanswered question
and unreconciled discord.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Her beloved minister was among those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
accompanied my mother on the visit to the army
which inspired &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.&#8221; This was written to the tune of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">John Brown&#8217;s body lies a-moldering in the grave,</div>
<div class="indent3">His soul is marching on.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Old Ossawotamie Brown&#8221; was the true hero
of the bloody little war in Kansas, where the Free
State men finally prevailed, though many lives
were lost. He has been called &#8220;Savior of Kansas
and Liberator of the Slave.&#8221; He came at least
once to Green Peace. My mother has described
her meeting with him. My father had told her
some time previously about a man who &#8220;seemed
to intend to devote his life to the redemption of
the colored race from slavery, even as Christ had
willingly offered His life for the salvation of mankind.&#8221;
One day he reminded her of the person
so described, and added: &#8220;That man will call here
this afternoon. You will receive him. His name
is John Brown.&#8221;...</p>

<p>Later, my mother wrote of this meeting:</p>

<p>&#8220;At the expected time I heard the bell ring, and,
on answering it, beheld a middle-aged, middle-sized
man, with hair and beard of amber color
streaked with gray. He looked a Puritan of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Puritans, forceful, concentrated, and self-contained.
We had a brief interview, of which I only
remember my great gratification at meeting one
of whom I had heard so good an account. I saw
him once again at Dr. Howe&#8217;s office, and then
heard no more of him for some time.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere she has written apropos of his raid
at Harper&#8217;s Ferry:</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us could exactly approve an act so
revolutionary in its character, yet the great-hearted
attempt enlisted our sympathies very strongly.
The weeks of John Brown&#8217;s imprisonment were
very sad ones, and the day of his death was one of
general mourning in New England.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>With the election of Lincoln we seemed to come
to smoother times. We young people certainly
did not realize that we were on the brink of civil
war, although friends who had visited the South
warned us of the preparations going on there.
If there should be any struggle, it would be a
brief one, people said.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a flash of lightning out of a clear
sky, came the firing on Sumter. My father came
triumphantly into the nursery and called out to
his children: &#8220;Sumter has been fired upon!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
That&#8217;s the death-blow of slavery.&#8221; Little did he
or we realize how long and terrible the conflict
would be. But he knew that the serpent had received
its death-wound. All through the long
and terrible war he cheered my mother by his
unyielding belief in the ultimate success of our
arms.</p>

<p>So the prelude ended and the greater tragedy
began. The conflict of ideas, the most soul-stirring
period of our history, passed into the conflict
of arms. In the midst of its agony the steadfast
soul of a woman saw the presage of victory
and gave the message, a message never to be forgotten,
to her people and to the world.</p>

<small>MRS. HOWE VISITS THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>The Civil War breaks out&mdash;Dr. Howe is appointed a member of the
Sanitary Commission&mdash;Mrs. Howe accompanies him to Washington&mdash;She
makes her maiden speech to a Massachusetts regiment&mdash;She
sees the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps&mdash;She visits
the army and her carriage is involved in a military movement&mdash;She
is surrounded by &#8220;Burnished rows of steel.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE years between 1850 and 1857, eventful
as they were, appear to me almost a period
of play when compared with the time of trial which
was to follow. It might have been likened to the
tuning of instruments before some great musical
solemnity. The theme was already suggested, but
of its wild and terrible development who could
have had any foreknowledge?&#8221;</p>

<p>In her <i>Reminiscences</i> my mother thus compares
the Civil War and its prelude. Again she says of
the former:</p>

<p>&#8220;Its cruel fangs fastened upon the very heart of
Boston and took from us our best and bravest.
From many a stately mansion father or son went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
forth, followed by weeping, to be brought back
for bitterer sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercifully she was spared this last. My father
was too old for military service and no longer in
vigorous health, being in his sixtieth year when the
war broke out; my eldest brother was just thirteen
years of age. Nevertheless she was brought into
close touch with the activities of the great struggle
from the beginning.</p>

<p>On the day when the news of the attack on
Fort Sumter was received Dr. Howe wrote to
Governor Andrew, offering his services:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since they will have it so&mdash;in the name of God,
Amen! Now let all the governors and chief men of
the people see to it that war shall not cease until emancipation
is secure. If I can be of any use, anywhere,
in any capacity (save that of spy), command me.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>With what swiftness the &#8220;Great War Governor
of Massachusetts&#8221; acted at this time is matter of
history. Two days after the President issued a
call for troops, three regiments started for Washington.
Massachusetts was thus the first State
to come to the aid of the Union&mdash;the first, alas!
to have her sons struck down and slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Governor Andrew was glad to avail himself of
Dr. Howe&#8217;s offer of aid. The latter&#8217;s early experiences
in Greece made his help and counsel
valuable both to the State and to the nation.
Gen. Winfield Scott, Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, and Governor Andrew requested him, on
May 2, 1861, to make a sanitary survey of the
Massachusetts troops in the field at and near the
national capital. Before the end of the month
the Sanitary Commission was created, Dr. Howe
being one of the original members appointed by
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Governor Andrew was almost overwhelmed
with the manifold cares and duties of his office.
Our house was one of the places where he took
refuge when he greatly needed rest. He was
obliged to give up going to church early in the
war because many people followed him there,
importuning him with requests of all sorts.</p>

<p>Thus the questions of the Civil War were
brought urgently to my mother&#8217;s mind in her
own home, just as those of the anti-slavery
period had been a year or two before.</p>

<p>To quote her <i>Reminiscences</i> again:</p>

<p>&#8220;The record of our State during the war was a
proud one. The repeated calls for men and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
money were always promptly and generously
answered. And this promptness was greatly forwarded
by the energy and patriotic vigilance of
the Governor. I heard much of this at the time,
especially from my husband, who was greatly attached
to the Governor and who himself took an
intense interest in all the operations of the war....
I seemed to live in and along with the war,
while it was in progress, and to follow all its ups
and downs, its good and ill fortune with these two
brave men, Dr. Howe and Governor Andrew.
Neither of them for a moment doubted the final
result of the struggle, but both they and I were
often very sad and much discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Governor Andrew was often summoned to
Washington. Dr. Howe&#8217;s duties as a member of
the Sanitary Commission also took him there.
Thus it happened that my mother went to the
national capital in their company in the late
autumn of 1861. Mrs. Andrew, the Governor&#8217;s
wife, Rev. James Freeman Clarke, and Mr. and
Mrs. Edwin P. Whipple were also of the party.</p>

<p>As they drew near Washington they saw ominous
signs of the dangers encompassing the city.
Mrs. Howe noticed little groups of armed men
sitting near a fire&mdash;pickets guarding the railroad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
her husband told her. For the Confederate Army
was not far off, the Army of the Potomac lying like
a steel girdle about Washington, to protect it.</p>

<p>This was my mother&#8217;s first glimpse of the Union
Army which later made such a deep impression
upon her mind and heart. I have always fancied,
though she does not say so, that some of the vivid
images of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; were suggested by
the scenes of this journey.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;</div>
<div class="verse">They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;</div>
<div class="verse">I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.</div>
<div class="indent15">His day is marching on!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Arrived at Washington, the party established
themselves at Willard&#8217;s Hotel. Evidences of the
war were to be seen on all sides. Soldiers on
horseback galloped about the streets, while ambulances
with four horses passed by the windows
and sometimes stopped before the hotel itself.
Near at hand, my mother saw &#8220;The ghastly advertisement
of an agency for embalming and forwarding
the bodies of those who had fallen in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
fight or who had perished by fever.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In the
vicinity of this establishment was the office of the
New York <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>Governor Andrew and Dr. Howe were busy with
their official duties; indeed, the former was under
such a tremendous pressure of work and care
that he died soon after the close of the war.
The latter &#8220;carried his restless energy and indomitable
will from camp to hospital, from battle-field
to bureau.&#8221; His reports and letters show
how deeply he was troubled by the lack of proper
sanitation among the troops.</p>

<p>My mother again came in touch with the Army,
visiting the camps and hospitals in the company
of Mr. Clarke and the Rev. William Henry Channing.
It need hardly be said that these excursions
were made in no spirit of idle curiosity.</p>

<p>In ordinary times she would not look at a cut
finger if she could help it. I remember her telling
us of one dreadful woman who asked to be shown
the worst wound in the hospital. As a result this
morbid person was so overcome with the horror
of it that the surgeon was obliged to leave his
patient and attend to the visitor, while she went
from one fainting fit into another!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Up to this time my mother had never spoken in
public. It was from the Army of the Potomac
that she first received the inspiration to do so.
In company with her party of friends she had made
&#8220;a reconnoitering expedition,&#8221; visiting, among
other places, the headquarters of Col. William B.
Greene, of the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery.
The colonel, who was an old friend, warmly welcomed
his visitors. Soon he said to my mother,
&#8220;Mrs. Howe, you must speak to my men.&#8221;
What did he see in her face that prompted him to
make such a startling request?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It must be remembered that in 1861 the women
of our country were, with some notable exceptions,
entirely unaccustomed to speaking in public. A
few suffragists and anti-slavery leaders addressed
audiences, but my mother had not at this time
joined their ranks.</p>

<p>Yet she doubtless then possessed, although
she did not know it, the power of thus expressing
herself. Colonel Greene must have read
in her face something of the emotion which
poured itself out in the &#8220;Battle Hymn.&#8221; He
must have known, too, that she had already
written stirring verses. So he not only asked, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
insisted that she should address the men under
his command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feeling my utter inability to do this, I ran
away and tried to hide myself in one of the
hospital tents. Colonel Greene twice found me
and brought me back to his piazza, where at last I
stood and told as well as I could how glad I was
to meet the brave defenders of our cause and how
constantly they were in my thoughts.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>I fear there is no record of this, her maiden
speech.</p>

<p>Throughout her long life church-going was a
comfort, one might almost say a delight, to her.
During this visit to Washington, where the weeks
brought so many sad sights, she had the pleasure
of listening on Sunday to the Rev. William Henry
Channing. Love of his native land induced him
to leave his pulpit in England and to return to
this country in her hour of darkness and danger.</p>

<p>My mother tells us that this nephew of the great
Dr. Channing was heir to the latter&#8217;s spiritual
distinction and deeply stirred by enthusiasm in a
noble cause. &#8220;On Sundays his voice rang out,
clear and musical as a bell, within the walls of the
Unitarian church&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;her own church. Thus she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
listened both in Washington and in Boston, her
home city, to men who were patriots as well as
priests.</p>

<p>As she tells the story, one sees how almost all the
circumstances of her environment tended to promote
her love of country and to stir the emotions
of her deeply religious nature. It was by no
accident that the national song which bears her
name is a hymn. Written at that time and amid
those surroundings, it could not have been anything
else.</p>

<p>Among her cherished memories of this visit was
an interview with Abraham Lincoln, arranged for
the party by Governor Andrew. &#8220;I remember
well the sad expression of Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s deep blue
eyes, the only feature of his face which could be
called other than plain.... The President was
laboring at this time under a terrible pressure of
doubt and anxiety.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The culminating event of her stay in Washington
was the visit to the Army of the Potomac on
the occasion of a review of troops. As the writing
of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was the immediate result
of the memorable experiences of that day, I
shall defer their consideration till the next chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>I have thus sketched briefly the train of events
and experiences both before and during the Civil
War which led up to the composition of this
national hymn. The seed had lain germinating
for years&mdash;at the last it sprang suddenly into
being. My mother&#8217;s mind often worked in this
way. It had a strongly philosophic tendency which
made her think long and study deeply. But she
possessed, also, the fervor of the poet. Her mental
processes were often extremely rapid, especially
under the stress of strong emotion. She
herself thought the quick action of her mind was
due to her red-haired temperament. The two
opposing characteristics of her intellect, deliberation
and speed, were perhaps the result of the
mixed strains of her blood inherited from English
and French ancestors.</p>

<p>The student of her life will note a number of
sudden inspirations, or visions, as we may call
them. Before these we can usually trace a long
period of meditation and reflection. Her peace
crusade, her conversion to the cause of woman
suffrage, her dream of a golden time when men
and women should work together for the betterment
of the world, were all of this description.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was the most notable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
these inspirations. In her <i>Recollections of the
Anti-Slavery Struggle</i> she ascribes its composition
to two causes&mdash;the religion of humanity and the
passion of patriotism. The former was a plant of
slow growth. In her tribute to Theodore Parker,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
she tells us how this developed under his preaching,
and how he prepared his hearers for the war of
blood and iron that soon followed.</p>

<p>My mother had long cherished love for her
country, but it burned more intensely when the
war came, bursting into sudden flame after that
memorable day with the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the war broke out, the passion of
patriotism lent its color to the religion of humanity
in my own mind, as in many others, and a
moment came in which I could say:</p>

<p class="center">Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!</p>

<p>&mdash;and the echo which my words awoke in many
hearts made me sure that many other people
had seen it also.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<small>&#8220;THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>&#8220;The crimson flower of battle blooms&#8221; in a single night&mdash;The vision
in the gray morning twilight&mdash;It is written down in the half-darkness
on her husband&#8217;s official paper of the U. S. Sanitary
Commission&mdash;How it was published in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
and the price paid for it&mdash;The John Brown air derived from a
camp-meeting hymn&mdash;The simple story in her own words.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OVER and over again, so many times that she
lost count of them, was my mother asked to
describe the circumstances under which she composed
&#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#8221;
Fortunately she wrote them down, so that we are
able to give &#8220;the simple story&#8221; in her own words.</p>

<p>The following account is taken in part from her
<i>Reminiscences</i> and in part from the leaflet printed
in honor of her seventieth birthday, May 27, 1889,
by the New England Woman&#8217;s Club. She was
president of this association for about forty years:</p>

<p>&#8220;I distinctly remember that a feeling of discouragement
came over me as I drew near the city
of Washington. I thought of the women of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
acquaintance whose sons or husbands were fighting
our great battle; the women themselves
serving in the hospitals or busying themselves
with the work of the Sanitary Commission. My
husband, as already said, was beyond the age of
military service, my eldest son but a stripling;
my youngest was a child of not more than two
years. I could not leave my nursery to follow the
march of our armies, neither had I the practical
deftness which the preparing and packing of sanitary
stores demanded. Something seemed to
say to me, &#8216;You would be glad to serve, but you
cannot help any one; you have nothing to give,
and there is nothing for you to do.&#8217; Yet, because
of my sincere desire, a word was given me to say
which did strengthen the hearts of those who
fought in the field and of those who languished in
prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the late autumn of the year 1861 I visited
the national capital with my husband, Dr. Howe,
and a party of friends, among whom were Governor
and Mrs. Andrew, Mr. and Mrs. E. P. Whipple,
and my dear pastor, Rev. James Freeman Clarke.</p>

<p>&#8220;The journey was one of vivid, even romantic,
interest. We were about to see the grim
Demon of War face to face, and long before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
reached the city his presence made itself felt in the
blaze of fires along the road, where sat or stood
our pickets, guarding the road on which we traveled.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day we drove out to attend a review of
troops, appointed to take place at some distance
from the city. In the carriage with me were
James Freeman Clarke and Mr. and Mrs. Whipple.
The day was fine, and everything promised well,
but a sudden surprise on the part of the enemy
interrupted the proceedings before they were well
begun. A small body of our men had been surrounded
and cut off from their companions, re-enforcements
were sent to their assistance, and
the expected pageant was necessarily given up.
The troops who were to have taken part in it were
ordered back to their quarters, and we also turned
our horses&#8217; heads homeward.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a long distance the foot soldiers nearly
filled the road. They were before and behind,
and we were obliged to drive very slowly. We
presently began to sing some of the well-known
songs of the war, and among them:</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;John Brown&#8217;s body lies a-moldering in the grave.&#8217;</p>

<p>This seemed to please the soldiers, who cried,
&#8216;Good for you,&#8217; and themselves took up the strain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Mr. Clarke said to me, &#8216;You ought to write some
new words to that tune.&#8217; I replied that I had
often wished to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of the excitement of the day I went to
bed and slept as usual, but awoke next morning in
the gray of the early dawn, and to my astonishment
found that the wished-for lines were arranging
themselves in my brain. I lay quite still
until the last verse had completed itself in my
thoughts, then hastily arose, saying to myself, &#8216;I
shall lose this if I don&#8217;t write it down immediately.&#8217;
I searched for a sheet of paper and an old stump
of a pen which I had had the night before and
began to scrawl the lines almost without looking,
as I had learned to do by often scratching down
verses in the darkened room where my little children
were sleeping. Having completed this, I
lay down again and fell asleep, but not without
feeling that something of importance had happened
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be noted that the first draft of the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was written on the back of a
sheet of the letter-paper of the Sanitary Commission
on which her husband was then serving.
Mr. A. J. Bloor, the assistant secretary of that
body, has called attention to this. His account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
of the eventful day is given at the close of this
chapter.</p>

<p>My mother gave the original draft of the &#8220;Battle
Hymn&#8221; to her friend, Mrs. Edwin P. Whipple,
&#8220;who begged it of me, years ago.&#8221; Hence below
the letter-heading:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sanitary Commission, Washington, D. C.<br />
Treasury Building</span><br />

<span class="indentleft"><i>1861</i></span></p>

<p>we find the inscription</p>

<p class="center">WILLARD&#8217;S HOTEL<br />
<span class="smcap">Julia W. Howe<br />
to<br />
Charlotte B. Whipple</span></p>

<p>The draft remained for many years in the possession
of the latter, until it was sent to Messrs.
Houghton &amp; Mifflin, in order to have a facsimile
made for the <i>Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Whipple were among the familiar
friends of our household in those days. The
former achieved brilliant successes both as a writer
and as a lecturer. He was greatly interested in
the anti-slavery agitation; &#8220;His eloquent voice
was raised more than once in the cause of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
freedom.&#8221; The younger members of our family
remember him best for his ready and delightful
wit. The fact that he was decidedly homely
seemed to give additional point to his funny sayings.
Mrs. Whipple was as handsome as her
husband was plain&mdash;sweet-tempered and sympathetic,
yet not wanting in firmness.</p>

<p>Before publishing the poem the author made
a number of changes, all of which are, as I think,
improvements. The last verse, which is an anticlimax,
was cut out altogether.</p>

<p>We find from her letters that she hesitated to
allow the publication of the original draft of the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> because it contained this final
verse. She did not consider it equal to the rest of
the poem.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> After consulting other literary people,
in her usual painstaking way, she decided to have
the first draft published.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It will be noted that
in the first verse &#8220;vintage&#8221; has been substituted
for &#8220;wine press.&#8221; The first line of the third verse
read originally,</p>

<p class="center">I have read a burning gospel writ in fiery rows of steel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The later version,</p>

<p class="center">I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:</p>

<p>brings out more clearly the image of the long lines
of bayonets as they glittered in her sight on that
autumn afternoon. In the fourth verse the second
line was somewhat vague in the first draft,</p>

<p class="center">He has waked the earth&#8217;s dull bosom with a high ecstatic beat,</p>

<p>The allusion was probably to the marching feet
of the armed multitude. The new version,</p>

<p class="center">He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat:</p>

<p>is more direct and simple, hence accords better
with the deeply religious tone of the poem.</p>

<p>In the last stanza,</p>

<p class="center">In the whiteness of the lilies he was born across the sea,</p>

<p>now reads,</p>

<p class="center">In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,</p>

<p>A number of people have asked the meaning
of this line. The allusion is evidently to the lilies
carried by the angel, in pictures of the annunciation
to the Virgin, these flowers being the emblem of
purity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The original version of the second line read,</p>

<p class="center">With a glory in his bosom that shines out on you and me,</p>

<p>The present words,</p>

<p class="center">Transfigures you and me,</p>

<p>give us a clearer and more beautiful image. The
passion of the poem seems, indeed, to lift on high
and glorify our poor humanity.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that my mother associated
with her husband the line,</p>

<p class="center"><i>He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat</i>;</p>

<p>Not long before her death, new buildings were
erected at Watertown, Massachusetts, for the
Perkins Institution for the Blind, founded and
administered for more than forty years by Dr.
Howe. His son-in-law, Michael Anagnos, ably
continued the work during thirty more years.</p>

<p>When we were talking about a suitable inscription
in memory of the latter, I suggested to my
mother the use of this line. The answer was,
&#8220;<i>No, that is for your father.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The original draft of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; is dated
November, 1861; it was published in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> for February, 1862. The verses were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
printed on the first page, being thus given the
place of honor. According to the custom of that
day, no name was signed to them. James T.
Fields was then editor of the magazine. My
mother consulted him with regard to a name for
the poem. It was he, as I think, who christened
it &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#8221; The
price paid for it was five dollars. But the true
price of it was a very different thing, not to be
computed in terms of money. It brought its
author name and fame throughout the civilized
world, in addition to the love and honor of her
countrymen. As she grew older and the spiritual
beauty of her life and thought shone out more and
more clearly, the affection in which she was held
deepened into something akin to veneration.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; soon found its way from the
pages of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> into the newspapers,
thence to army hymn-books and broadsides. It
has been printed over and over again, in a great
variety of forms, sometimes with the picture of the
author, as in the Perry prints. A white silk handkerchief
now in my possession bears the line,</p>

<p class="center">Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord</p>

<p>worked in red embroidery silk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>My mother was called upon to copy the poem
times without number. While she was very willing
to write a line or even, upon occasion, a verse or two,
she objected very decidedly, especially in her later
years, to copying the whole poem. Always responsive
to the requests of the autograph fiend,
she felt that so much should not be asked of her.
For it naturally took time and trouble to make the
fair copy that came up to her standard. It was
with some difficulty that I persuaded her to send
a promised copy to Edmund Clarence Stedman,
for his collection.</p>

<p>&#8220;But mamma, you <i>said</i> you would write it out
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a roguish twinkle, she replied, &#8220;Yes, but
I did not say <i>when</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the verses were duly executed and
sent to the banker-poet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; has been
translated into Spanish, Italian, Armenian, and
doubtless other languages. New tunes have been
composed for it, but they have failed of acceptance.
My mother dearly loved music and was a
trained musician, hence her choice of a tune was no
haphazard selection. She wrote her poem to the
&#8220;John Brown&#8221; air and they cannot be divorced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>I have been so fortunate as to secure from
Franklin B. Sanborn an account of the origin of
the words and music of the &#8220;John Brown&#8221; song.
Mr. Sanborn, biographer of Thoreau, John Brown,
and others, is the last survivor of the brilliant
group of writers belonging to the golden age of
New England literature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Concord, Mass.</span>, <i>1916</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Hall</span>&mdash;I investigated quite thoroughly the
air to which the original John Brown folk song was set;...</p>

<p>I happened to be in Boston the day that Fletcher
Webster&#8217;s regiment (the 12th Mass. Volunteers) came up
from Fort Warren, landed on Long Wharf, and marched
up State Street past the old State House, on their way to
take the train for the Front, in the summer of 1861. As
they came along, a quartette, of which Capt. Howard Jenkins,
then a sergeant in this regiment, was a tenor voice, was
singing something sonorous, which I had never heard. I
asked my college friend Jacobsen, of Baltimore, who stood
near me, &#8220;What are they singing?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;That boy
on the sidewalk is selling copies.&#8221; I approached him and
bought a handbill which, without the music, contained the
rude words of the John Brown song, which I then heard
for the first time, but listened to a thousand times afterward
during the progress of the emancipating Civil War&mdash;before
they were superseded by Mrs. Howe&#8217;s inspired lines, which
now take their place almost everywhere.</p>

<p>The chorus was borne by the marching soldiers, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
practised it in their drills at the Fort; indeed, it had been
adapted from a camp-meeting hymn to a marching song,
for which it is admirably fitted, by the bandmaster of Col.
Webster&#8217;s regiment, and afterward revised by Dodworth&#8217;s
military band, then the best in the country. It was this
thrilling music, with its resounding religious chorus, which
Mrs. Howe, in company with our Massachusetts Governor
Andrew, heard near the Potomac, the next November, in
the evening camps that encircled Washington.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">F. B. Sanborn</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The following account of Mrs. Howe&#8217;s visit to
Washington and of the circumstances connected
with the writing of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was
written by Mr. A. J. Bloor, assistant secretary of
the U. S. Sanitary Commission:</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;JULIA WARD HOWE</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the writer&#8217;s privilege to be introduced
early in the Civil War to Julia Ward Howe, the
author of &#8216;The Battle Hymn of the Republic,&#8217;
and now, through the fullness of her days, the
dean of American literature, though recognized
long ago as having employed her high gift of
utterance not merely as the magnet to attract to
herself an advantageous celebrity, but paramountly
as the instrument for the righting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
wrong and the amelioration of the current conditions
of humanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was presented to Mrs. Howe by her husband,
Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, a companion of Lord
Byron in aiding the Greeks to throw off the yoke
of the Turks, and the philanthropist who opened
the gates of hope to the famous Laura Bridgman,
born blind, deaf, and dumb. Dr. Howe invented
various processes by which he rescued her from
her living tomb, as he subsequently did others
born to similar deprivations, and he was careful
to leave on record such exhaustive and clear statements
as to his methods that, after his decease, the
track was well illumined wherein later any well-doer
for other victims in like case might open to
them, through their single physical sense of touch,
the doors leading to all earthly knowledge so far
stored in letters....</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Howe, on the outbreak of the Civil War,
consented to serve as a member of the U. S.
Sanitary Commission, a volunteer organization
of influential Union men, springing from a central
association in New York City for the relief of the
forces serving in the war, and consisting of a few
Union ladies, one of whom, Miss Louisa Lee
Schuyler, suggested the formation of a similar but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
larger and wider-spread body of men, representing
the Union sentiment of the whole North, into
which her own society should be merged as one of&mdash;so
it turned out&mdash;many branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a body was accordingly enrolled and,
with Dr. Bellows, a prominent Unitarian clergyman
of the day, as its president, was appointed a
commission, by President Lincoln, as a <i>quasi</i>
Bureau of the War Department, to complement
the appliances and work of the Government&#8217;s
Medical Bureau and Commissariat, which, at the
sudden outbreak of the war, were very deficient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of this commission I was the assistant secretary,
with headquarters at its central office in
Washington.... On the occasion of General
McClellan&#8217;s first great review of the Army of the
Potomac&mdash;numbering at that time about seventy
thousand men&mdash;at Upton&#8217;s Hill, in Virginia, not
far from the enemy&#8217;s lines, Dr. Howe asked me to
accompany him thither on horseback to see it,
which I did. Mrs. Howe had preceded us, with
several friends, by carriage, and it was there, in
the midst of the blare and glitter and bedizened
simulacra of actual and abhorrent warfare, that
he did me the honor of presenting me to his wife,
then known, outside her private circle, only as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the author of a book of charming lyrical essays;
but for years since recognized, and doubtless, in
the future, will be adjudged, the inspired creator
of a war song which for rapt outlook, reverent
mysticism, and stateliness of expression, as well
as for more widely appreciated patriotic ardor,
has more claim, in my estimation, to be styled a
hymn than not a few that swell the pages of some
of our hymnals. I have always thought it an
honor even for the Sanitary Commission with all
its noble work of help to the nation in its straits,
and of mercy to the suffering, that Julia Ward
Howe&#8217;s &#8216;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8217; should
have been written on paper headed &#8216;U. S. Sanitary
Commission,&#8217; as may be seen by a facsimile
of it in her delightful volume of reminiscences.
It seems a pity that Mrs. Howe, an accomplished
musical composer in private, as well as a poet in
public, should not herself have set the air for her
own words in that famous utterance of insight,
enthusiasm, and prophecy.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE ARMY TAKES IT UP</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>Gloom in Libby Prison, July 6, 1863&mdash;The victory of Gettysburg&mdash;Chaplain
McCabe sings &#8220;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the
coming of the Lord&#8221;&mdash;Five hundred voices take up the chorus&mdash;The
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; at the national capital&mdash;The great throng
shout, sing, and weep&mdash;Abraham Lincoln listens with a strange
glory on his face&mdash;The army takes up the song.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; was inspired
by the tremendous issues of the war,
as they were brought vividly to the poet&#8217;s mind
by the sight of the Union Army.</p>

<p>My mother had seen all that she describes&mdash;she
had been a part of the great procession of &#8220;burnished
rows of steel&#8221; when her carriage was surrounded
by the Army. She had heard the soldiers
singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;John Brown&#8217;s body lies a-moldering in the grave,</div>
<div class="indent2">His soul is marching on.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Old John Brown who had</p>

<p class="center">Died to make men free,</p>

<p>whose spirit the army knew to be with them!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>All this sank deeply into the heart of the poet.
The soul of the Army took possession of her.
The song which she wrote down in the gray
twilight of that autumn morning voiced the
highest aspirations of the soldiers, of the whole
people. Hence, when the armies of freedom heard
it, they at once hailed it as their own. My mother
writes in her <i>Reminiscences</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The poem, which was soon after published
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, was somewhat praised on
its appearance, but the vicissitudes of the war
so engrossed public attention that small heed was
taken of literary matters. I knew, and was content
to know, that the poem soon found its way
to the camps, as I heard from time to time of its
being sung in chorus by the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the beginning, but the interest increased
as the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; became more and
more widely known, until it grew to be one of the
leading lyrics of the war. It was &#8220;sung, chanted,
recited, and used in exhortation and prayer on
the eve of battle.&#8221; &#8220;It was the word of the
hour, and the Union armies marched to its
swing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;singing chaplain&#8221;&mdash;Rev. Charles Cardwell
McCabe of the 122d Ohio Regiment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Volunteers, did much to popularize this war
lyric. Reading it in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, he was
so charmed with the lines that he committed
them to memory before arising from his chair. A
year or so later, while attending the wounded men
of his regiment, after the battle of Winchester
(June, 1863), he was taken prisoner and carried
to Libby Prison. Here he was a living benediction
to the prisoners. Deeply religious by nature
and blest with a cheerful, happy disposition, he
kept up the spirits of his companions, ministering
alike to their bodily and spiritual needs. Thus he
begged three bath-tubs for them, an inestimable
treasure, even though these had to serve the needs
of six hundred men. Books, too, he procured for
them, for the prisoners at this time comprised a
notable company of men&mdash;doctors, teachers, editors,
merchants, lawyers. &#8220;We bought books
when we needed bread,&#8221; the chaplain tells us.</p>

<p>With the music of his wonderful voice he was
wont to dispel the gloom that often settled upon
the inmates of the prison. Many stories are told
of its power, pathos, and magnetism. Whenever
the dwellers in old Libby felt depression settling
upon their spirits they would call out, &#8220;Chaplain,
sing us a song.&#8221; Then &#8220;The heavy load<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that oppressed us all seemed as by magic to be
lifted.&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>July 6, 1863, was a dark day for the prisoners.
They were required to cast lots for the selection
of two captains who were to be executed. These
officers were taken to the dungeon below and told
to prepare for death. Then the remaining men
huddled together discussing the situation. The
Confederate forces were marching north, and a
terrible battle had been fought. Grant was striving
to capture Vicksburg, the key to the Mississippi,
with what result they did not know. The
Richmond newspapers brought tidings of disaster
to the Union armies. In startling head-lines the
prisoners read: &#8220;Meade defeated at Gettysburg.&#8221;
&#8220;The Northern Army fleeing to the mountains.&#8221;
&#8220;Grant repulsed at Vicksburg.&#8221; &#8220;The campaign
closed in disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pall deeper and darker than death settled
upon the Union prisoners. The poor, emaciated
fellows broke down and cried like babies. They
lost all hope. &#8220;We had not enough strength left
to curse God and die,&#8221; as one of them said later.</p>

<p>&#8220;By and by &#8216;Old Ben,&#8217; a negro servant, slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
in among them under pretense of doing some work
about the prison; concealed under his coat was
a later edition of the paper, on which the ink
was scarcely dry. He looked around upon the
prostrate host, and called out, &#8216;Great news in de
papers.&#8217; If you have never seen a resurrection,
you could not tell what happened. We sprang to
our feet and snatched the papers from his hands.
Some one struck a light and held aloft a dim
candle. By its light we read these head-lines:</p>

<p>&#8216;Lee is defeated! His pontoons are swept
away! The Potomac is over its banks! The
whole North is up in arms and sweeping down
upon him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The revulsion of feeling was almost too great to
endure. The boys went crazy with joy. They
saw the beginning of the end.&#8221; Chaplain McCabe
sprang upon a box and began to sing:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>and the five hundred voices sang the chorus,
&#8220;Glory, Glory, Hallelujah,&#8221; as men never sang
before. The old negro rolled upon the floor in
spasms of joy. I must not forget to add that the
two captains were <i>not</i> executed, after all.</p>

<p>Chaplain McCabe remained in Libby Prison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
until October, 1863, when an attack of typhoid
fever nearly cost him his life. As soon as his
health would permit, he resumed his labors in behalf
of the Army, this time as a delegate of the
United States Christian Commission. His deep
religious feeling, of which patriotism was an integral
part, had a great influence among the
soldiers. Wherever he went he took the &#8220;Battle
Hymn&#8221; with him. &#8220;He sang it to the soldiers
in camp and field and hospital; he sang it in school-houses
and churches; he sang it at camp-meetings,
political gatherings, and the Christian Commission
assemblies, and all the Northland took it up.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>As he wrote the author:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sung it a thousand times since and
shall continue to sing it as long as I live. No
hymn has ever stirred the nation&#8217;s heart like &#8216;The
Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I must not forget to say that the singing chaplain
made excellent use of this war lyric to raise
funds for the work among the soldiers. With
his matchless voice he sang thousands of dollars
out of the people&#8217;s pockets into the treasury of
the Christian Commission.</p>

<p>On February 2, 1864, a meeting in the interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of the Christian Commission was held in the hall
of the House of Representatives at Washington.
Hannibal Hamlin, Vice-President of the United
States, presided. Abraham Lincoln was present,
and an immense audience filled the hall. Various
noted men spoke; then Chaplain McCabe made
a short speech and, &#8220;by request,&#8221; sang the &#8220;Battle
Hymn.&#8221; The effect on the great throng was
magical. &#8220;Men and women sprang to their feet
and wept and shouted and sang, as the chaplain
led them in that glorious &#8216;Battle Hymn&#8217;; they
saw Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s tear-stained face light up
with a strange glory as he cried out, &#8216;<i>Sing it
again!</i>&#8217; and McCabe and all the multitude sang
it again.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless many Grand Army posts have
among their records stories of the inspiring influence
of this song in times of trouble or danger.
Such an anecdote was related at the Western home
of Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, where Acker Post
had been invited to meet my mother:</p>

<p>&#8220;Capt. Isaac Mahan affectingly described a
certain march on a winter midnight through
eastern Tennessee. The troops had been for days
without enough clothing, without enough food.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
They were cold and wet that stormy night, hungry,
weary, discouraged, morose. But some one
soldier began, in courageous tones, to sing &#8216;Mine
eyes have seen&mdash;&#8217; Before the phrase was finished
a hundred more voices were heard about the hopeful
singer. Another hundred more distant and
then another followed until, far to the front and
away to the rear, above the splashing tramp of
the army through the mud, above the rattle of
the horsemen, the rumble of the guns, the creaking
of the wagons, and the shouts of the drivers, there
echoed, louder and softer, as the rain and wind-gusts
varied, the cheerful, dauntless invocation
of the &#8216;Battle Hymn.&#8217; It was heard as if a
heavenly ally were descending with a song of
succor, and thereafter the wet, aching marchers
thought less that night of their wretched selves,
thought more of their cause, their families, their
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. A. J. Bloor, assistant secretary of the
United States Sanitary Commission, has given us
some vivid pictures of the soldiers as they sang
the hymn:</p>

<p>&#8220;Time and again, around the camp-fires scattered
at night over some open field, when the
Army of the Potomac&mdash;or a portion of it&mdash;was on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the march, have I heard the &#8216;Battle Hymn of
the Republic&#8217;&mdash;generally, however, the first verse
only, but in endless repetition&mdash;sung in unison by
hundreds of voices&mdash;occasions more impressive
than that of any oratorio sung by any musical
troupe in some great assembly-room. And I remember
how, one night in the small hours, returning
to Washington from the front, by Government
steamer up the Potomac, with a party of
&#8216;San. Com.&#8217; colleagues and Army officers, mostly
surgeons, we found our horses awaiting us at the
Seventh Street dock; and how, mounting them,
we galloped all the long distance to our quarters,
singing the &#8216;Battle Hymn&#8217;&mdash;this time the whole
of it&mdash;at the top of our voices.&#8221;</p>

<small>NOTABLE OCCASIONS WHERE IT HAS BEEN SUNG</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>By great crowds in the street after Union victories in the Civil War&mdash;On
the downfall of Boss Croker&mdash;At Memorial Day celebrations
from the Atlantic to the Pacific&mdash;At the Chicago convention
where the General Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs indorsed
woman suffrage&mdash;At Brown University and Smith College when
Mrs. Howe received the degree of LL.D.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; has been
sung and recited thousands of times, by
all sorts of people under widely varying circumstances,
yet the key-note of it is most fitly struck
when men and women are lifted out of themselves
by the power of strong emotion. In times of
danger and of thanksgiving the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221;
is now, as it was in the &#8217;sixties, the fitting vehicle
for the expression of national feeling. Indeed, it
has been so used in other countries as well as in
our own. In my mother&#8217;s journal the entry often
occurs, &#8220;They sang my &#8216;Battle Hymn.&#8217;&#8221; Usually
she makes no comment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>It would, of course, be impossible and it might
be tedious to rehearse all the notable occasions
where this national song has been given. Yet
many of them have been so full of interest as to
demand a place in the story of the &#8220;Battle
Hymn.&#8221; The record would be incomplete without
them. I give a few which will serve as
samples.</p>

<p>In New York City there was a good deal of disloyal
sentiment during the Civil War. Here the
draft riots took place in the summer of 1863, when
the guns from the battle of Gettysburg were rushed
to the metropolis. Here the cannon, their wheels
still deeply incrusted with mud, were drawn up,
a grim reminder to the rioters of the actual
meaning of war. To these the sight of a uniform
was odious. My husband, David Prescott Hall,
then a young lad returning from a summer camping
trip, was chased through the streets by some
excited individuals. As he had a knapsack on his
back, they mistook him for a soldier.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that New York City
had also a large loyal population. In the early
days of the war men suspected of secession sympathies
were visited by deputations of citizens who
insisted upon their displaying the flag. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
found it wiser to do so. After one of the final
victories of the war, perhaps the taking of Richmond,
a great crowd gathered before the bulletin-board
of a New York newspaper. Some one
started to sing the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; and the
whole mass of people took it up, &#8220;<i>Glory, Glory,
Hallelujah!</i>&#8221; What else could so well have expressed
the joy and thanksgiving of our people,
weary of four long years of fratricidal war! My
husband, who was present, described the scene as
being most impressive.</p>

<p>F. B. Sanborn in his <i>Early History of Kansas</i>
tells us an interesting story of the singing of the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; on a very different occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;People were gathered together to hear a sermon
from Col. James Montgomery, a man of undaunted
courage and a veteran both of the Civil
War and of the Kansas struggle. The place was
Trading Post, where, during the Kansas troubles,
some fourteen years before this time, a massacre
had been perpetrated. Among his audience were
survivors and relatives of the slain. There were
present, too, a score of men who had &#8216;shouted
amen when their renowned leader registered his
vow that the blood of the dead and the tears of
the widows and children should not be shed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
vain.&#8217; Montgomery was of the indomitable
Scotch-Irish blood, tall and slender, with a shaggy
shock of long black hair and even shaggier whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;As he arose to begin the services and fixed his
gaze on the familiar faces of those who had suffered
and whose sufferings he had so fully avenged,
a gleam of joy and satisfaction seemed to blaze
from his penetrating eyes and thrilled the audience
into perfect accord. He hesitated a moment,
and then requested all to arise and sing
&#8216;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#8217; The noble
thought of that grand hymn stirred the crowd to
the deepest depths of feeling. The text was in
keeping with the occasion:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Be not deceived. God is not mocked, for
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
reap.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The discourse was powerful and impressive.
He reminded his hearers of his prophecy that the
remaining years of slavery could be numbered
on the fingers of one hand, and that he should
lead a host of negro soldiers, arrayed in the
national uniform, in the redemption of the country
from the curse of slavery. A few days afterward
the old Covenanter was dead!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>To the Grand Army of the Republic Julia Ward
Howe was especially dear. On Memorial Day a
detachment always visits and decorates her grave,
with simple but impressive ceremonies. Upon
that of her husband, which lies next to hers, the
Greeks always lay flowers. This festival of remembrance
comes only three days after my
mother&#8217;s birthday, May 27th. In 1899, when she
was eighty years of age, the ceremonies in Boston
were of unusual interest.</p>

<p>The Grand Army of the Republic held a celebration
in Boston Theater, Major-General Joseph
Wheeler, formerly an officer in the Confederate
Army, having been invited to deliver the address.
Mrs. Howe rode thither in an open carriage with
the general&#8217;s two daughters, &#8220;<i>very</i> pleasant girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Philadelphia <i>Press</i> thus describes the occasion:</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;BOSTON WARMED UP</p>

<p>&#8220;The major has just returned from Boston,
where he was present at the Memorial Day
services held in Boston Theater.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the real thing. I never imagined possible
such a genuine sweeping emotion as when
that audience began to sing the &#8216;Battle Hymn.&#8217;
If Boston was cold, it was thawed by the demonstration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
on Tuesday. Myron W. Whitney started
to sing. He bowed to a box, in which we first
recognized Mrs. Howe, sitting with the Misses
Wheeler. You should have heard the yell. We
could see the splendid white head trembling;
then her voice joined in, as Whitney sang, &#8216;In
the beauty of the lilies,&#8217; and by the time he had
reached the words, &#8216;As He died to make men
holy, let us die to make men free,&#8217; the whole
vast audience was on its feet, sobbing and singing
at the top of its thousands of lungs. If volunteers
were really needed for the Philippines, McKinley
could have had us all right there.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was in her adopted city of Boston, where
she had lived for more than half a century. The
Grand Army men of California gave her a similar
reception on Memorial Day, 1888.</p>

<p>We quote extracts from the San Francisco papers
describing it:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Grand Opera House never contained a
larger audience. Not only were all the chairs
taken up but every inch of standing-room was pre-empted.
There were many persons who could not
gain an entrance.... Mr. Dibble next called the
attention of the audience to the fact that Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe, the author of &#8216;The Battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Hymn of the Republic,&#8217; was among the guests of
the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this juncture an enthusiastic gentleman in
one of the front seats sprang up and called for
three cheers for Mrs. Howe. They were given
with a vim, Mrs. Howe acknowledging the compliment
by rising and bowing.... The next event
upon the program was the singing of &#8216;The
Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8217; by J. C. Hughes.
The singing was preceded by a scene rarely witnessed
and which was not on the printed program.
General Salomon introduced Mrs. Howe
to the audience in an appreciative speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;A beautiful floral piece was then presented to
Mrs. Howe, which she acknowledged in fitting
terms, while the audience gave three cheers and
a tiger for the author of &#8216;The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Howe advanced to the footlights, beaming
with pleasure. She then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My dear friends, I cannot, with my weak
voice, reach this vast assemblage; but I will endeavor
to have some of you hear me. I join in
this celebration with thrilled and uplifted heart.
I remember those camp-fires, I remember those
dreadful battles. It was a question with us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
women, &#8220;Will our men prevail? Until they do,
they will not come home.&#8221; How we blessed them
when they did; how we blessed them with our
prayers when they were on the battle-field. Those
were times of sorrow; this is one of joy. Let us
thank God who has given us these victories.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As Mrs. Howe was about to resume her seat
the audience rose <i>en masse</i>, and from the dress-circle
to the upper gallery rung a round of cheers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The audience remained standing while Mr.
Hughes sang the stirring words of the hymn, and
joined heartily in the chorus as by request. At
the last chorus Mrs. Howe stepped forward and
joined in the song, closing with a general flutter
of handkerchiefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother visited the Pacific coast twice in
the latter years of her life, as her beloved sister,
Mrs. Adolphe Mailliard, then lived there. She
was received in a way that was very gratifying to
her and her family.</p>

<p>One of the most dearly prized privileges of a self-governing
people is that of constant grumbling
over the administration of affairs and of finding
fault with our rulers&mdash;who, in the last analysis,
are ourselves. In England men write to the <i>Times</i>;
in America we write to many papers and we complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
endlessly. This would evidently be impossible
under a despotic Government, and it
sometimes seems as if we indulged too freely in
depreciating our own country and its institutions.
Yet deep down in the hearts of our people is a love
of our native land which flames forth brightly on
great occasions. The country which produced the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; is not lacking in true patriotism.
So long as our people use it to express their deepest
emotions we need fear no serious treason to the
Republic. The danger of our frequent fault-finding
is that we thus allow our righteous indignation
to evaporate in mere words.</p>

<p>Supineness in politics, an indolence which permits
unworthy men to usurp the reins of government,
is one of our great sins as a nation. Yet the corrupt
manipulator who goes too far meets an uprising
of popular indignation which thoroughly
surprises him. From the New York <i>Sun</i> we quote
the story of such a day of retribution.</p>

<p>At the downfall of Boss Croker &#8220;a throng
gathered in Madison Square. Not even in a
Presidential election in recent years have there
been such innumerable hosts as gathered in front
of the Fifth Avenue Hotel and the Hoffman House
last night to hear of the doom of Croker and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
cronies. Cheer upon cheer ascended when the
mighty army read that Low was far ahead and
would win in the great battle.&#8221; Some one struck
up the &#8220;Battle Hymn.&#8221; &#8220;All over the square
were heard the thousands singing this great hymn....
There has not been such a scene in New York
City since war days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the notable occasions we must certainly
count the unveiling of the Shaw Monument.
Here the art of St.-Gaudens has preserved in immemorial
stone the story of Robert Gould Shaw
and his colored soldiers, the heroes of Fort Wagner.
The monument stands just within old Boston
Common, facing the State House. The ceremonies
of dedication included a procession and a
meeting in Music Hall, where Prof. William James
and Booker Washington made the principal addresses,
and the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was sung.</p>

<p>My mother is best known as the author of the
&#8220;Battle Hymn.&#8221; Soon after the war she began her
efforts in behalf of the woman&#8217;s cause, which
eventually won for her the great affection of her
countrywomen as well as a reputation extending
to foreign shores. She was deeply interested both
in the club and in the suffrage movement. She
lived to see the full flowering of the former and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
partial success of the latter. Despite the many
weary trials and delays she never lost faith in the
ultimate victory of the suffrage cause. &#8220;I shall live
to see women win the franchise in New York State,&#8221;
she declared, not many years before her death.</p>

<p>In the early days of the club movement my
mother, like most of her fellow-suffragists, thought
it best not to mingle the two issues. While the
more advanced thinkers among the club women
believed in the enfranchisement of their sex, the
majority did not.</p>

<p>At last the two movements&mdash;like two rapidly
flowing streams that have long been drawing
nearer together&mdash;joined in one mighty river. I
have often wished my mother could have lived to
see that wonderful day at Chicago when the
General Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs&mdash;an association
comprising more than one and a half
million women&mdash;declared themselves, amid cheers
and tears, in favor of votes for women. Every
one was deeply moved; the delegates embraced
one another, and the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was sung&mdash;a
hymn this time of joyous thanksgiving for the
victory obtained, yet of solemn dedication, too, to
the hard labor still to be performed before the
good fight could be fully won.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>My mother describes one occasion where the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was given in dumb show before
the Association for the Advancement of Women.
She was very much attached to this pioneer society,
of which she was the president during many
years. The association held annual congresses in
different parts of the United States, the proceedings
eliciting much interest. When they were at
X&mdash;&mdash; one of the members invited the society
to visit a school for young girls of which she was
the principal.</p>

<p>&#8220;After witnessing some interesting exercises we
assemble in the large hall, where a novel entertainment
has been provided for us. A band of
twelve young ladies appear upon the platform.
They wear the colors of &#8216;Old Glory,&#8217; but after a
new fashion, four of them being arrayed from head
to foot in red, four in blue, and four in white.
While the &#8216;John Brown&#8217; tune is heard from the
piano, they proceed to act in graceful dumb show
the stanzas of my &#8216;Battle Hymn.&#8217; How they did
it I cannot tell, but it was a most lovely performance.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In the early days of the woman movement a
hard struggle was necessary in order to secure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
girls the advantages of the higher education. Into
this my mother threw herself with her accustomed
zeal. A lifelong student and lover of books, she
ardently desired to secure for other women the advantages
she herself so highly prized. Enjoying
robust health, and accustomed to prolonged mental
labor, she never doubted the capacity of her sex
for serious study. So, despite the gloomy prognostications
of learned doctors (all men), she and
her fellow-suffragists persevered until the battle
was won. Thus it was very fitting that the three
institutions which bestowed honorary degrees
upon her&mdash;Tufts College, Brown University, and
Smith College&mdash;all counted women among their
students. Her youngest daughter, Maud Howe
Elliott, thus describes the scene at Providence:<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;On June 16th (1909) Brown University, her
husband&#8217;s <i>alma mater</i> and her grandfather&#8217;s,
conferred upon her the degree of Doctor of Laws....
Her name was called last. With the deliberate
step of age, she walked forward, wearing her
son&#8217;s college gown over her white dress, his mortar-board
cap over her lace veil. She seemed less
moved than any person present; she could not see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
what we saw, the tiny gallant figure bent with
four score and ten years of study and hard labor.
As she moved between the girl students who
stood up to let her pass, she whispered: &#8216;How tall
they are! It seems to me the girls are much taller
than they used to be.&#8217; Did she realize how much
shorter she was than she once had been? I think
not. Then, her eyes sparkling with fun while all
other eyes were wet, she shook her hard-earned
diploma with a gay gesture in the faces of those
girls, cast on them a keen glance that somehow
was a challenge, &#8216;Catch up with me if you can!&#8217;&#8221;
The band played the air of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221;
and applause followed her as she went back to her
seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had labored long for the higher education
of women, suffered estrangement, borne ridicule
for it&mdash;the sight of those girl graduates, starting
on their life voyage equipped with a good education,
was like a sudden realization of a lifelong
dream, uplifted her, gave her strength for the
fatigues of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A similar scene was enacted in October, 1910,
shortly before her death, when Smith College conferred
the same degree upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Opposite the platform, as if hung in air, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
curving gallery was filled with white-clad girls,
some two thousand of them; as she entered they
rose like a flock of doves, and with them the
whole audience. They rose once more when her
name was called, last in the list of those honored
with degrees, and as she came forward, the organ
pealed, and the great chorus of fresh young voices
broke out with&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the last time.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<small>HOW AND WHERE THE AUTHOR RECITED IT</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>The simplicity and deep earnestness of her manner&mdash;Her clear and
musical voice which never grew old&mdash;How Susan B. Anthony
&#8220;mixed up&#8221; two songs&mdash;Gladdened by the love and honor which
it brought her, Mrs. Howe repeats the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; in all
parts of the country before all sorts of audiences, small and great&mdash;Why
its appeal to the human heart is universal.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT may be imagined that the heart of the woman
who wrote the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; was greatly
gladdened by the love and honor which it brought
her. She enjoyed to the full the beautiful affection
shown her by her countrymen and countrywomen,
and, in my opinion, her happy and sympathetic
relations with them prolonged her life.
She was glad to live, despite the physical weakness
of old age, because she knew that she was widely
beloved and could still be of use. Her mind remained
clear and brilliant to the very last.</p>

<p>The honors paid her she received with the
humility that dreads over-praise. In her journal
she questions her worthiness to be made so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of, and hopes to the end that she may be able to do
something of value to mankind.</p>

<p>The recital of her &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; gave so much
pleasure that she was very willing to repeat it,
under suitable circumstances. She was asked
to do so at all times and seasons and in all sorts of
places. People who requested her to recite her
war lyric at the close of a lecture did not realize
the fatigue that it entailed upon a person no longer
young and already weary with speaking. Yet I
doubt if she ever refused, when it was possible for
her to comply with the request. Not long before
her death, some ladies, calling upon her at her
summer home near Newport, begged her to recite
then and there the &#8220;Battle Hymn.&#8221; She was
loth to do so, feeling the solemn words were not
at all in keeping with the light and pleasant chat
of a morning visit. As one of the callers was
frankly an old lady, my mother at length consented.
According to her custom when asked to
recite under such circumstances, she withdrew for
a few minutes before beginning.</p>

<p>There are thousands of people now living, I suppose,
who have heard the author&#8217;s recitation of
the &#8220;Battle Hymn.&#8221; Yet because there are
thousands who never did hear it, and because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
these things slip so easily out of mind, it is well to
give some description of it &#8220;<i>Lest we forget</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother repeated the verses of the hymn
simply, yet with a solemnity that was all the more
impressive because there was no effort at elocutionary
or dramatic effect. Yet there was sufficient
variety in the recitation to avoid any approach
to monotony. Thus she repeated the lines</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;O be swift, my soul, to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>with uplifted hands, a downward glance at her
feet, and voice slightly raised. Her distinct enunciation
and the clear, musical tones of a voice that
never grew old, made the words audible even in a
large auditorium.</p>

<p>Her deeply serious manner, corresponding so
well as it did with the solemn, prophetic words of
the &#8220;Battle Hymn,&#8221; made the recitation very
impressive.</p>

<p>We saw before us the woman who had been
privileged to speak the word for the hour, in the
dark days of her country&#8217;s history. It was like
seeing some priestess of old delivering the sacred
oracle to her people. Though the message was
repeated so many times, it never lost its power to
stir the souls of those who heard it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>It should be said that the habit of speaking very
carefully, my mother formed early in life. Having
a brother who stammered, she was very anxious
to avoid that defect of speech. The beauty of
her voice was due to its careful training in the
Italian school of singing in her youth. Doubtless
the habit of public speaking also tended to preserve
it.</p>

<p>She occasionally repeated &#8220;The Flag,&#8221; a more
dramatic and more personal poem than the &#8220;Battle
Hymn.&#8221; Her rendering of it, accordingly, was
more dramatic.</p>

<p>On public occasions my mother was often introduced
as &#8220;The author of &#8216;The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.&#8217;&#8221; Sometimes the introducer would, by
mistake, substitute the name of another war song,
good of its kind, but hardly to be compared with
my mother&#8217;s hymn. She used to say, rather
plaintively, that Miss Susan B. Anthony (the well-known
suffrage leader) <i>would</i> mix up the two songs,
introducing her as &#8220;<i>The author of the &#8216;Battle Cry of
Freedom.&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a joy to her to be associated with the
&#8220;Battle Hymn,&#8221; yet she sometimes grieved a
little because this so greatly overshadowed all her
other literary productions. She had labored long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and earnestly with pen and voice, writing both
prose and poetry which won commendation from
her comrades in the world of letters. Hence she
was glad to be remembered as the author, not only
of her war lyric, but of other compositions as well.</p>

<p>My mother was asked to repeat this more and
more often as its fame increased and as she herself
became ever dearer to her countrymen. As early
as 1865 we find that she was urged to recite it at
Newport at the close of her lecture in Mr. Richard
Hunt&#8217;s studio. Among those in the audience was
George Bancroft, the historian, a prominent figure
in Newport society of the olden days. Mr. Bancroft
had held various offices under the Federal
Government, that of Secretary of the Navy among
others. When the Civil War broke out there was
a good deal of secession feeling among the summer
residents of the watering-place, but Mr. and Mrs.
Bancroft were steadfastly loyal to the Union.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that among the many
places where its author recited the &#8220;Battle
Hymn,&#8221; at least one city in the heart of the South
is included. Mrs. Howe spent the winter of 1884-85
in New Orleans, having been invited to preside
over the woman&#8217;s department of the exposition
held there in that year.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The experience involved much hard work, but
also much pleasure. She made many friends in
the Crescent City, whither she and I returned
eleven years later for a congress of the Association
for the Advancement of Women. We were the
guests of her old friend, Mrs. King, the mother of
Grace King, the novelist, and were entertained by
mother and daughters with charming hospitality.</p>

<p>I confess that it surprised me when, at an
afternoon reception in the King drawing-room, my
mother was asked to repeat the &#8220;Battle Hymn,&#8221;
and did so. This showed us how much the old
ill-feeling between North and South had died out.
It demonstrated also the universal and therefore
non-sectional quality of the poem, of which more
will be said in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; may be called universal
in still another sense, since it appeals to men and
women of all religious creeds. When Mrs. Howe
was especially requested to recite it before a
council of Jewish women, it gave her &#8220;an unexpected
thrill of satisfaction.&#8221; She was warmly
received and welcomed, but felt some anxiety
lest the verse beginning &#8220;In the beauty of the
lilies Christ was born across the sea&#8221; might disturb
her hearers. The president assured her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
however, that there was nothing in it to hurt
their feelings.</p>

<p>My mother was so intimately associated with the
woman movement that she was called upon to
repeat her war lyric before many feminine audiences.
We have spoken of her interest in
women&#8217;s clubs. She was also interested in the
patriotic societies, being a member of the D. A. R.
and of the Colonial Dames of Rhode Island.
One of the Boston chapters of the former is named
in honor of the Old South Meeting-house, a venerated
landmark of the city. When the congregation
left their old place of worship and moved to
the Back Bay, it required a tremendous effort
on the part of the women of Boston to raise the
necessary funds and to save the historic building
from destruction. Here, in December, 1906, the
Old South Chapter had a meeting where there
was &#8220;much good speaking.&#8221; My mother recited
her &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; and told them something of
her Revolutionary ancestors. She remembered
her forebears with affectionate pride as noble men
and women whose example she strove to imitate.</p>

<p>A long life brings its penalties as well as its
pleasures. Living to the age of nearly ninety-two
years, my mother survived all the friends of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
her youth and most, if not all, of her contemporaries.
Hence she was called upon to attend
many funerals, considering this a duty, in accordance
with old-fashioned ideas. A temporary
lameness prevented her attending the obsequies
of the poet Longfellow, an early friend of her husband&#8217;s,
whom she also had known well for many
years. She was able, however, to testify to her
friendship for the gentle poet by giving her services
for the Longfellow Memorial held at the Boston
Museum. Here she took part in an authors&#8217; reading,
reciting the &#8220;Battle Hymn,&#8221; as well as some
verses composed in honor of the poet.</p>

<p>That she should be invited to do so shows a
great change in public opinion since the early
years of their acquaintance. In the &#8217;forties and
&#8217;fifties it was not thought fitting that a lady should
even sign her name to a poem or a novel, much
less read it in public. When my mother published
some verses in a volume edited by Mr.
Longfellow in those early days, they appeared as
anonymous. By his advice, her first book of
poems, <i>Passion Flowers</i>, bore no name upon the
title-page.</p>

<small>TRIBUTES TO &#8220;THE BATTLE HYMN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>From Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Conan Doyle, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, William Dean Howells,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> U. S. Senator George
F. Hoar, Thomas Starr King, Ina Coolbrith, and others&mdash;The
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; and the &#8220;Marseillaise&#8221;&mdash;What Rudyard Kipling
said of it in &#8220;The Light that Failed&#8221;&mdash;English reprints distributed
among the soldiers of the present war.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE appeal of &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the
Republic&#8221; is so wide that it takes in all
classes of mankind, all, at least, who love freedom.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Wherever rise the peoples,</div>
<div class="indent">Wherever sinks a throne,</div>
<div class="verse">The throbbing heart of freedom</div>
<div class="indent">Finds an answer in his own.</div>
</div></div>

<p>So wrote the poet Whittier of Samuel Gridley
Howe, remembering his services to the Greeks,
to the Poles and others. The lines are equally
true of his wife, Julia Ward Howe, and of the
spirit animating her war lyric. Although written
in the midst of the greatest civil war that was
ever fought and won, there is no word of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
or South, no appeal to local pride or patriotism,
no word of sectional strife or bitterness. The God
to whom appeal is made is the God of freedom.
The enemy to be overcome, the serpent who is to
be crushed beneath the heel of the hero, is slavery.</p>

<p>It is amusing and yet sad to find that some
literal souls have fancied that my mother intended
to designate the Southerners by &#8220;the grapes of
wrath.&#8221; Needless to say that the writer intended
no such narrow and prosaic meaning.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; may well be compared to
the &#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221; The man is to be pitied who
can hear either of them without a thrill of answering
emotion. Both have the power to move
their hearers profoundly, yet they are as different
as the two nationalities which gave them
birth. The French national hymn appeals to us
by its wonderfully stirring music more than by the
words. We can imagine how the latter aroused
to a frenzy of feeling the men of the French Revolution,
when they rose to throw off the yoke of
centuries of oppression and misrule. Feudalism
perished in France to the fiery music of the
&#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221; Slavery died in America to the
old &#8220;John Brown&#8221; tune, as slow and steadfast in
movement as the Northern race who sang it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>In our war lyric we seem to hear an echo
of the old cry, &#8220;The sword of the Lord and of
Gideon.&#8221; Yet we did not fully recognize its
tremendous power until Kipling christened it
&#8220;<i>The terrible Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the closing scene of <i>The Light that Failed</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
we are shown a group of English newspaper correspondents
about to start for a war in the Soudan.
They are met together for a last evening of song
and merrymaking, yet one of their number &#8220;by
the instinct of association began to hum the terrible
Battle Hymn of the Republic. Man after
man caught it up&mdash;it was a tune they knew well,
till the windows shook to the clang, the Nilghai&#8217;s
deep voice leading:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir A. Conan Doyle pays a similar tribute to
its power in <i>Through the Magic Door</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the songs which they sang during the
most bloody war which the Anglo-Celtic race has
ever waged&mdash;the only war in which it could have
been said that they were stretched to their uttermost
and showed their true form ... all had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
playful humor running through them. Only one
exception do I know, and that is the most tremendous
war song I can recall; even an outsider
in time of peace can hardly read it without emotion.
I mean, of course, Julia Ward Howe&#8217;s war
song of the Republic, with the choral opening line,</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.&#8217;</p>

<p>If that were ever sung upon a battle-field the
effect must have been terrific.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the present war in Europe, an English
lady has had a large number of copies of the
&#8220;Hymn&#8221; printed and distributed, through the
Young Men&#8217;s Christian Association, to the soldiers.
They contain the following explanation: &#8220;This
magnificent &#8216;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8217; was
written in 1861 by a famous American lady,
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, for the Army of the
Northern States of America, which were then
engaged in a &#8216;Holy War&#8217; to rid the South of
slavery and to preserve the Union of the States.
It is said to have done more to awaken the spirit
of patriotism and to have inspired more deeds of
heroism than any other event of the American
Civil War.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is pleasant and heartening to read these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
tributes of praise from distinguished Englishmen.
That our &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; should
so strongly appeal to them shows us the essential
unity of the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon
race, even though oceans roll between
Great Britain and America.</p>

<p>The strange glory that came over the face of
Abraham Lincoln and the tears he shed on hearing
the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; will always be, for his
countrymen, the most precious tribute to its power.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chaplain afterward stated that in his
conversation with Mr. Lincoln at his reception, the
President said to him, &#8216;Take it all in all, the
song and the singing, that was the best I ever
heard.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>To the steadfast and courageous soul of another
great American, who also has held the high office
of President of these United States, Theodore
Roosevelt, this war hymn strongly appealed. His
book, <i>Fear God and Take Your Own Part</i>, is
prefaced by &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221;
and by the following dedication:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;This book is dedicated to the memory of<br />
<span class="smcap">Julia Ward Howe</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>because in the vital matters fundamentally affecting
the life of the Republic she was as good a
citizen of the Republic as Washington and Lincoln
themselves. She was in the highest sense a good
wife and a good mother, and therefore she fulfilled
the primary law of our being. She brought up
with devoted care and wisdom her sons and her
daughters. At the same time she fulfilled her
full duty to the commonwealth from the public
standpoint. She preached righteousness and she
practised righteousness. She sought the peace
that comes as the handmaiden of well-doing.
She preached that stern and lofty courage of soul
which shrinks neither from war nor from any
other form of suffering and hardship and danger
if it is only thereby that justice can be served.
She embodied that trait more essential than any
other in the make-up of the men and women of
this Republic&mdash;the valor of righteousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the letter given below, Hon. George F. Hoar,
United States Senator from Massachusetts, compares
&#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; with
the &#8220;Marseillaise&#8221; and with the &#8220;British National
Anthem.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Worcester, Mass.</span>, <i>May 22, 1903</i>.</p>

<p>I was thinking, just as I got your letter asking me to send
a greeting to your meeting and to Mrs. Howe, of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
power, in framing the character of nations, of their National
Anthems. Fletcher of Saltoun said, as every child knows,
&#8220;Let me make the songs of a people, and I care not who
make their laws.&#8221; No single influence has had so much to
do with shaping the destiny of a nation, as nothing more
surely expresses national character, than what is known
as the National Anthem. France adopted for hers the
&#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221; Its stirring appeal</p>

<p class="center">Sons of France, awake to glory!</p>

<p>led the youth of France to march through Europe, subduing
kingdoms and overthrowing dynasties, till &#8220;forty centuries
looked down on them from the pyramids.&#8221; At last the
ambition of France perished and came to grief, as every
unholy ambition is destined to perish and come to grief,
and her great Emperor died in exile at St. Helena.</p>

<p>Is there anything more cheap and vulgar than the National
Anthem of our English brethren, &#8220;God Save the King&#8221;?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O Lord our God, arise!</div>

<div class="verse">Frustrate their knavish tricks;</div>
<div class="verse">On him our hopes we fix;</div>
<div class="verse">God save us all!</div>
</div></div>

<p>England, I hope, knows better now. But she has acted
on that motto for a thousand years.</p>

<p>New England&#8217;s Anthem,</p>

<p class="center">The breaking waves dashed high,</p>

<p>one of the noblest poems in all literature, was written by a
woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>We waited eighty years for our American National Anthem.
At last God inspired an illustrious and noble woman to utter
in undying verse the thought which we hope is forever to
animate the soldier of the Republic.</p>

<p>Julia Ward Howe cannot yet vote in America. But her

<p>In the journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson we
find this tribute to his friend, Julia Ward Howe:</p>

<p>&#8220;I honour the author of the &#8216;Battle Hymn&#8217; and
of &#8216;The Flag.&#8217; She was born in the city of New
York. I could well wish she were a native of
Massachusetts. We have had no such poetess in
New England.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little bit of State pride voiced in the regret
that my mother was not a native of the old Bay
State, surprises us in a man of such wide sympathies
as Mr. Emerson. In Whittier&#8217;s early poems
also the local feeling is strongly pronounced. We
should remember, however, that during the nineteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
century a good deal of sectional feeling
still existed in the different States. The twentieth
century finds us more closely united as a people
than we have ever been before.</p>

<p>Edmund Clarence Stedman happily characterizes
the war hymn in the following passage.
It occurs in a letter to me, asking that my mother
would copy it for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well understand what a Frankenstein&#8217;s
monster such a creation grows to be&mdash;such a poem
as the &#8216;Battle Hymn&#8217; when it has become the
sacred scroll of millions, each one of whom would
fain obtain a copy of it.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Those who have visited the White Mountains
will remember that one of the peaks is called
&#8220;Starr King.&#8221; It was named for Thomas Starr
King, a noted Unitarian preacher in the middle
of the nineteenth century. Shortly before the
Civil War he accepted a call to San Francisco.
In addition to officiating in the church there he
soon took upon his shoulders a task that was too
heavy for his somewhat frail physique. This was
nothing less than persuading the people of California
to remain loyal to the Union. There was a
good deal of secession sentiment on the Pacific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
coast in 1861. Starr King and his fellow-Unionists
succeeded in their undertaking, but he paid
the penalty of overwork with his life. Hence his
memory is beloved and revered on the shores of
the Pacific as well as on those of the Atlantic.
One can imagine what the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; must
have meant to him, weary as he was with his
strenuous labors. He pronounced it &#8220;a miraculously
perfect poem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another &#8220;Spray of Western Pine&#8221; was contributed
to the garland of praise by Ina Coolbrith,
one of the last survivors of the golden age of
California literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>When memorial services were held in honor of
my mother, Boston&#8217;s great Symphony Hall was
crowded to its utmost capacity. Many were the
beautiful tributes to her given by men and women
of national reputation. None, however, equaled
in heartfelt eloquence the speech of Lewis, the
distinguished negro lawyer. As he poured out
the gratitude of his race to the woman who had
written &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic,&#8221; I
suddenly realized for the first time what the words
meant to the colored people.</p>

<p class="center">As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.</p>

<p>&#8220;To make us, black men and black women, free!&#8221;
The appeal was to the white men of our country,
bidding them share the freedom they so dearly
prized with the despised slave. And this triumphant
gospel of liberty with its stirring chorus of
&#8220;Glory, glory, hallelujah&#8221; was sung wherever the
Northern army went. It was the first proclamation
of emancipation. If it moves us, how must
it have affected the people to whom it was a
prophecy of the longed-for deliverance from
bondage.</p>

<small>MRS. HOWE&#8217;S LESSER POEMS OF THE CIVIL WAR</small></h2>

Parricide&#8221; written on the day of Lincoln&#8217;s funeral to express
her reverence.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY mother&#8217;s natural mode of expressing herself
was by poetry rather than by prose.
She wrote verses from her earliest years up to the
time of her death. It is true that some of her
best work took the form of prose in her essays,
lectures, and speeches,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> yet whenever her feelings
were deeply moved she turned to verse as the fittest
vehicle for her use.</p>

<p>We have seen that she began to write poems
protesting against human slavery at an early
period of her career. Thus her first published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
&#8220;On the Death of the Slave Lewis.&#8221; In <i>Words
for the Hour</i> we find several poems dealing with
slavery, the struggle in Kansas, the attack on
Sumner, and kindred subjects. The titles of these
and some quotations from them are given in
Chapter I. The verses on &#8220;Tremont Temple&#8221;
contain tributes to Sumner and Frederick Douglass,
the negro orator. The first two are as follows:
volume, <i>Passion Flowers</i> (1853), contained verses</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Two figures fill this temple to my sight,</div>
<div class="indent">Whoe&#8217;er shall speak, their forms behind him stand;</div>

<div class="indent">And wields Jove&#8217;s thunder in his lifted hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The other wears the solemn hue of Night</div>
<div class="indent">Drawn darker in the blazonry of pain,</div>
<div class="verse">Blotting the gaslight&#8217;s mimic day, he slings</div>
<div class="indent">A dangerous weapon, too, a broken chain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the Civil War broke out, she poured forth
the feelings that so deeply moved her in a number
of poems. &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221;
is the best known of these, as it deserves to be.
The others, however, while varying as to merit,
show the same patriotism, indignation against
wrong, and elevation of spirit. The woman&#8217;s tenderness
of heart breathes through them, too, as
in the story of the dying soldier:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<div class="indent3">Farewell, comrades, farewell!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It will be remembered that the first blood shed
in the Civil War was in Baltimore. There the
Massachusetts troops, while on their way to defend
the national capital, were attacked by &#8220;Plug-Uglies&#8221;
and several soldiers were killed. My
mother thus describes the funeral in Boston:<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;We were present when these bodies were received
at King&#8217;s Chapel burial-ground, and could
easily see how deeply the Governor was moved
at the sad sight of the coffins draped with the
national flag. This occasion drew from me the
poem:</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;OUR ORDERS</p>

<div class="indent">For orphans that must earn their bread!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="center">(We give the first two of the six verses.)</p>

<p>Other verses published in <i>Later Lyrics</i> under the
title &#8220;April 19&#8221; commemorate the same event.
They were evidently written in the first heat of
indignation at the breaking out of the rebellion,
yet her righteous wrath always gave way to a
second thought, tenderer and more merciful than
the first. We see this in the last verse of the
&#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; and in various other poems of
hers. The opening verses of &#8220;April 19&#8221; are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<div class="verse">When men who bear our Country&#8217;s flag</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Of her &#8220;Poems of the War&#8221; &#8220;The Flag&#8221; ranks
second in popular esteem and has a place in many
anthologies. She thus describes the circumstances
under which it was composed:<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Even in gay Newport there were sad reverberations
of the strife. I shall never forget an
afternoon on which I drove into town with my
son, by this time a lad of fourteen, and found
the main street lined with carriages, and the carriages
filled with white-faced people, intent on I
knew not what. Meeting a friend, I asked:
&#8216;Why are these people here? What are they waiting
for and why do they look as they do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They are waiting for the mail. Don&#8217;t you
know that we have had a dreadful reverse?&#8217; Alas!
this was the second battle of Bull Run. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
made some record of it in a poem entitled &#8216;The
Flag,&#8217; which I dare mention here because Mr.
Emerson, on hearing it, said to me, &#8216;I like the
architecture of that poem.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The opening verse is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There&#8217;s a flag hangs over my threshold, whose folds are more dear to me</div>
<div class="verse">Than the blood that thrills in my bosom its earnest of liberty;</div>
<div class="verse">And dear are the stars it harbors in its sunny field of blue</div>
<div class="verse">As the hope of a further heaven, that lights all our dim lives through.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Before the war, Newport had been a favorite
resort for Southerners. During the summer of
1861 a number were still there, and it must be
confessed some of them behaved with very little
tact. According to reports current at the time,
these individuals carried politics inside the church
doors. When the prayer for the President of the
United States was read, they arose from their knees
in order to show their disapproval. At its conclusion
they again knelt. Women would draw
aside the voluminous skirts then in fashion, to
prevent their coming in contact with the United
States flag. I have always fancied that the lines
in &#8220;The Flag,&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p class="center">Salute the flag in its virtue, or pass on where others rule,</p>

<p>were inspired by this behavior of &#8220;The Secesh,&#8221;
as we then called them. Some of these persons,
although belonging to good society, had the bad
taste to boast in our presence of how the South
was going to &#8220;whip&#8221; the North. At a certain
picnic among the Paradise Rocks, my mother resolved
to give these people a lesson in patriotism.
One of our number, a quiet, elderly lady, was
selected to act as America, the queen of the occasion.
She was crowned with flowers, and we all
saluted her with patriotic songs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The First Martyr&#8221; tells the story of a visit
to the wife of John Brown before the latter&#8217;s
execution:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Our Country&#8221; contains no word about the
civil strife, although it is classed with &#8220;Poems of
the War&#8221; in her volume entitled <i>Later Lyrics</i>.
A prize was offered for a national song while the
war was in progress, and Mrs. Howe sent in this
poem, Otto Dresel composing the music. Mr.
Dresel was a prominent figure in the musical world
of Boston for many years and wrote a number of
charming songs.</p>

<p>The prize which had been offered for the national
song was never awarded, if I remember aright, and
Mr. Dresel decided to use the tune he had composed,
for the &#8220;Army Hymn&#8221; of Oliver Wendell
Holmes. This was &#8220;superbly sung by L. C.
Campbell, assisted by the choir and band&#8221; at
the opening exercises of the Great Metropolitan
Fair held in New York during the Civil War, for
the benefit of the Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Country&#8221; thus lost its musical setting, to
my mother&#8217;s regret.</p>

<p>The news of Lincoln&#8217;s assassination dealt a
stunning blow to our people. The rejoicings over
the end of the Civil War were suddenly changed
to deep sorrow, indignation, and fear. How
widely the conspiracy spread we did not know.
It will be remembered that other officers of the
Federal Government were attacked. My mother
wrote that nothing since the death of her little
boy<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> had given her so much personal pain. As
usual, she sought relief for her feelings in verse.
&#8220;The Parricide,&#8221; written on the day of Lincoln&#8217;s
funeral, expresses her love and reverence for the
great man, her horror of the &#8220;Fair assassin,
murder&mdash;white,&#8221; whom she bids:</p>

<p>As usual, compassion followed anger. &#8220;Pardon,&#8221;
written a few days later, after the death of Wilkes
Booth, is the better poem of the two.</p>

<p>On July 21, 1865, Harvard University held
memorial exercises in honor of her sons who had
given their lives for their country. The living
graduates of that day numbered only twenty-four
hundred, including the aged, sick, and absent.
Of these more than five hundred went out to fight
in behalf of the Union, many of them to return no
more. Their names may be seen engraved on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
marble tablets of Memorial Hall, Cambridge, a
daily lesson in patriotism to the undergraduates
who frequent it. Full of fun and nonsense as the
latter are, they will permit no disrespect to the
memory of the heroes of the Civil War. If
visitors enter without removing their hats, an instant
clamor arises, forcing them to do so.</p>

<p>On this Commencement day of 1865 a notable
assemblage gathered at Harvard. In addition to
other distinguished people there were present, as
Governor Andrew said in his address, a &#8220;cloud of
living witnesses who have come back laden with
glory from the fields where their comrades fell.&#8221;
Phillips Brooks made a prayer, Ralph Waldo
Emerson and others spoke. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Rev. Charles T. Brooks, James Russell
Lowell, his brother Robert, John S. Dwight, and
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe contributed poems. The
verses of the latter were read by her friend, Mr.
Samuel Eliot. The opening ones are as follows:</p>


<p class="center">RETURN</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Another of her war poems speaks in the name
of the sons of the old university. When it was
published in the newspapers, a careless typesetter
made some errors in setting it up. I remember
how troubled she was when the line</p>

<p class="center">O give them back, thou bloody breast of Treason&mdash;</p>

<p>was printed &#8220;beast&#8221; of Treason.</p>

<p>We give a single verse of the &#8220;Harvard Student&#8217;s
Song&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Remember ye how, out of boyhood leaping,</div>
<div class="indent">Our gallant mates stood ready for the fray,</div>
<div class="verse">As new-fledged eaglets rise, with sudden sweeping,</div>
<div class="indent">And meet unscared the dazzling front of day?</div>
<div class="verse">Our classic toil became inglorious leisure,</div>
<div class="indent">We praised the calm Horatian ode no more,</div>
<div class="verse">But answered back with song the martial measure,</div>
<div class="indent">That held its throb above the cannon&#8217;s roar.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The other &#8220;Poems of the War&#8221; published in
<i>Later Lyrics</i> are entitled &#8220;Requital,&#8221; &#8220;The Question,&#8221;
&#8220;One and Many,&#8221; &#8220;Hymn for a Spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Festival,&#8221; &#8220;The Jeweller&#8217;s Shop in War-time,&#8221;
and &#8220;The Battle Eucharist.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these we see how deeply the writer&#8217;s soul was
oppressed by the sorrow of the war and the horrors
of the battle-field. We see, too, how it
turned ever for comfort and encouragement to the
Cross and to the Lord of Hosts.</p>

<small>MRS. HOWE&#8217;S LOVE OF FREEDOM AN INHERITANCE</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>Stories of Gen. Francis Marion&mdash;Mrs. Howe&#8217;s kinship with the
&#8220;Swamp Fox&#8221;&mdash;The episode that saved &#8220;Marion&#8217;s Men&#8221;&mdash;The
splendid sword that rusted in its scabbard&mdash;John Ward, one of
Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s Ironsides&mdash;Samuel Ward, the only Colonial
governor who refused to enforce the Stamp Act&mdash;Roger Williams,
founder of Rhode Island and champion of religious liberty.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE have seen that my mother&#8217;s love of
freedom was in part the result of environment.
It was also an inheritance from men who
had fought for civil and religious liberty, with the
sword and with the pen, on both sides of the
Atlantic. Of the founder of the Ward family in
America, we know that he fought for the English
Commonwealth and against &#8220;Charles First, tyrant
of England.&#8221; He was one of Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s
Ironsides, serving as an officer in a cavalry regiment.
After the republic perished and the Stuart
line in the person of Charles II. returned to the
throne, doughty old John Ward came to America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
bringing his good sword with him. Whether it
was ever used on this side of the water, the record
does not say, but it was preserved in the family
for nearly a century.</p>

<p>His descendants held positions of trust and responsibility
under the State, his grandson and
great-grandson being each in his turn governor of
Rhode Island. The latter, Gov. Samuel Ward, has
the distinction of being the only Colonial governor
who refused to take the oath to enforce the Stamp
Act. As the Chief Executive of &#8220;little Rhody&#8221;
was chosen by the people, his views were naturally
more democratic than those of governors appointed
by the crown. Still, it took courage to refuse
to obey the royal mandate. He early foresaw the
separation from Great Britain and wrote to his
son in 1766, &#8220;These Colonies are destined to an
early independence, and you will live to see my
words verified.&#8221; He was a member of the Continental
Congresses of 1774 and 1775. The latter
resolved itself into a committee of the whole
almost every day, and Governor Ward was constantly
called to the chair on such occasions, until
he was seized with fatal illness, March 13, 1776,
dying soon afterward.</p>

<p>At this time vaccination had not been discovered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the only preventive of the terrible scourge
of smallpox being inoculation. Now Governor
Ward could not spare time for the brief illness
which this process involved. In addition to his
duties in Congress he was obliged, owing to the
physical disability of his colleague, Gov. Stephen
Hopkins, to conduct all the official correspondence
of the Rhode Island delegation, with the Government
and citizens of the colony. His services
were required on many committees, notably on the
secret committee which contracted for arms and
munitions of war. Hence, worn down by overwork,
he fell an easy victim to smallpox. He died
three months before his colleagues signed the
Declaration of Independence. As he early saw
the necessity of separation from the mother
country, he would certainly have affixed his
signature to it had he lived. His descendants may
be pardoned for thinking that he made a great mistake
in not taking the time required for inoculation.</p>

<p>Many of Governor Ward&#8217;s letters have been preserved.
These show his ardent patriotism as well
as the devout religious spirit of the men of 1776.
He writes to his brother: &#8220;I have realized with
regard to myself the bullet, the bayonet, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
halter; and compared with the immense object
I have in view they are all less than nothing.
No man living, perhaps, is more fond of his children
than I am, and I am not so old as to be tired
of life; and yet, as far as I can now judge, the
tenderest connections and the most important
private concerns are very minute objects. Heaven
save my country! I was going to say is my first,
my last, and almost my only prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gov. Samuel Ward was a Seventh-Day Baptist.
The little church in which he worshiped at Newport
has all the charm of the best architecture of
that period. It now forms part of the Historical
Society&#8217;s rooms.</p>

<p>His son, Lieut.-Col. Samuel Ward, grandfather
of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, joined the Continental
Army when the Revolution broke out. Governor
Ward writes of &#8220;the almost unparalleled sufferings
of Samuel,&#8221; and these were indeed severe.
Of the ill-fated expedition to Quebec, Colonel
Ward writes: &#8220;We were thirty days in a wilderness
that none but savages ever attempted to pass.
We marched one hundred miles upon shore with
only three days&#8217; provisions, waded over three rapid
rivers, marched through snow and ice barefoot ...
moderately speaking, we have waded one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
miles.&#8221; The result of this exposure was &#8220;the
yellow jaundice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans were overpowered by superior
numbers, Colonel Ward being taken prisoner with
many others. He was also at Valley Forge in that
terrible winter when the American Army endured
such great privations.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Colonel Ward assisted
in raising a colored regiment in the spring
of 1778. He commanded this in the engagement
on the island of Rhode Island, near the spot where
his granddaughter and her husband established
their summer home a century later. From the
peaceful windows of &#8220;Oak Glen&#8221; one sees, in the
near foreground, the earthworks of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In spite of all the hardships endured during the
Revolutionary War, Colonel Ward lived to be
nearly seventy-six years of age. My mother well
remembered her grandfather with his courtly
manner and mild, but very observing, blue eyes.
With the indulgence characteristic of grandparents,
he permitted the Ward brothers to play cards at his
house, a thing they were forbidden to do at home.</p>

<p>The State of Rhode Island is represented in the
statue-gallery of the national Capitol by Roger
Williams, pioneer of religious liberty and founder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
of the State, and by Gen. Nathaniel Greene, who
rendered such important service during the Revolutionary
War. My mother was related to both
men, being a direct descendant of the former.</p>

<p>Whether or no Massachusetts was justified in
driving out Roger Williams, we will not attempt to
decide. He was evidently a person who delighted
in controversy in a day when religious toleration
was almost unknown.</p>

<p>To him belongs the honor of being the first to
found a State &#8220;upon the distinctive principle of
complete separation of Church and State.&#8221; Maryland
followed not long after the example set by the
&#8220;State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not in Massachusetts alone did people object
to his doctrines. His work, <i>The Bloody Tenent of
Persecution</i>, was burned in England by the common
hangman, by order of Parliament.</p>

<p><i>George Fox Digged Out of His Burrowe</i> seems
a volume of formidable proportions to the modern
reader. With Quaker doctrines Roger Williams
had small patience, although he permitted members
of the persecuted sect to live in the Colony. It
seems that G. Fox did not avail himself of an offer
of disputation on fourteen proposals. His opponents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
claimed that he &#8220;slily departed&#8221; to avoid the
debate. It went on just the same, being &#8220;managed
three days at Newport and one day at Providence.&#8221;</p>

<p>This volume, <i>George Fox</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, is dedicated to
Charles II. by &#8220;Your Majestyes most loyal and
affectionate Orator at the Throne of Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>One can guess how much attention the Merrie
Monarch paid to the fourteen &#8220;proposalls&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and
the elaboration thereof.</p>

<p>The best testimony to the essential gentleness
and goodness of this eccentric divine is the behavior
toward him of the Indians. During King
Philip&#8217;s war they marched on Providence with the
intention of burning it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The well-attested tradition is that Roger Williams,
now an old man, alone and unarmed, save
with his staff, went out to meet the band of approaching
Indians. His efforts to stay their
course were unavailing, but they allowed him to return
unmolested, such was the love and veneration
entertained for him by these savages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of my mother&#8217;s ancestors on the maternal side,
the most interesting was her great-great-uncle,
Gen. Francis Marion, the partisan leader of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Revolution. She was descended from his sister
Esther, &#8220;The Queen Bee of the Marion Hive,&#8221; the
general himself having no children.</p>

<p>Many romantic stories are told of him. He was
present at a drinking-party during the siege of
Charleston when the host, determined that no one
should leave the festivities until some particularly
fine Madeira had been disposed of, locked the
door and threw the key out of the window.
Marion had no notion of taking part in any excesses,
so he made his escape by jumping out of
the window. A lame ankle was the result, and
the Huguenot left the city, all officers unfit for
duty being ordered to depart. Marion took
refuge now with one friend, now with another, and
again he was obliged to hide in the woods, while recovering
from this lameness. The accident was
a most fortunate one, however. If he had remained
in Charleston he would have been obliged
to surrender and the brigade of &#8220;Marion&#8217;s Men&#8221;
might never have existed.</p>

<p>How he formed it in the darkest hour of the war
in the South is a matter of history. How, like
so many will-o&#8217;-the-wisps, they led the British
a weary dance &#8220;thoro&#8217; bush, thoro&#8217; brier,&#8221; all
through the woods and the swamps of South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Carolina, is a tale that delights the heart of every
school-boy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Well knows the fair and friendly moon</div>
<div class="indent">The men that Marion leads,</div>
<div class="verse">The glitter of the rifles,</div>
<div class="indent">The scamper of their steeds;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis life to guide the fiery barb</div>
<div class="indent">Across the moonlit plain:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis life to feel the night-wind</div>
<div class="indent">That lifts the tossing mane.</div>
<div class="verse">A moment in the British camp,</div>
<div class="indent">A moment and away,</div>
<div class="verse">Back to the pathless forest</div>
<div class="indent">Before the peep of day.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>The best-known story tells of the British officer
who was brought blindfolded into Marion&#8217;s camp
and entertained at a dinner consisting solely of
sweet potatoes. Small wonder that he made up his
mind the Americans could not be conquered, since
they were able to subsist on such scanty rations!</p>

<p>Reversing the text of Scripture, General Marion
provided his men with swords made of saws, ammunition
being scanty. He was as well known
for his humanity as for his ingenuity. It is said
that once, wishing to draw his sword, he found it
rusted into the scabbard, so little had it been used.</p>

<p>When my mother, as occasionally happened in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
her later years, would quietly slip off on some expedition
which her daughters feared was too much
for her strength, we would remember her kinship
with the &#8220;Swamp Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of her parents, it should be said that both were
deeply religious. Her mother, Julia Cutler Ward,
a woman of very lovely character and intellectual
tastes, died at the early age of twenty-seven. Her
father, Samuel Ward, one of the &#8220;Merchant
Princes of Wall Street,&#8221; was well known for his
integrity, liberality, and public spirit. He was
especially interested in the causes of temperance
and religion, being &#8220;one of the foremost promoters
of church-building in the then distant West.&#8221; He
was also one of the founders of the New York
University, and owned the first private picture-gallery
in New York.</p>

<p>Thus we see that my mother, like so many of
her fellow-Americans, came from a long line of
God-fearing and patriotic men and women. In
the words of the &#8220;Battle Hymn&#8221; we hear not
only the voice of the Union Army, but an echo
of all the aspiring thoughts and noble deeds of the
builders of our great Republic.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
